\section{Coronary artery disease}
\label{sec:cad}
- CAD is serious.
- Describe the pheontype
- Describe prevalence
- Check intro of Anja, papers for more info
- Go into treatment and Risk
- herditary parts in disease

\section{GWAS}
\label{sec:gwas}

    \subsection{GWAS}
    \label{subsec:gwas_general}
    What are GWAS. Describe how it works, why we do it.

    \subsection{Post GWAS}
    \label{subsec:gwas_limit}
    And their limitations. Possible follow up studies. Focus on computational and cell based assays.

\section{Muscle Cells in CAD}
\label{sec:haosms}
- We now that smooth muscle cells play a key role
- It is widely accepted that there is not only one type of smooth muscle cell
- Go into the contractile phenotype and synthetic phenotype
    - TGFb or PDGF used to induce them
    - contractile phenotype is thought to be protective

\section{PDGF Signaling and Oxidative Stress}
\label{sec:haosms}
    \subsection{PDGF Signaling}
    \label{subsec:pdf_signaling}

    \subsection{ROS}
    \label{subsec:ROS}
    - ROS in general and the role of ROS in disease

    \subsection{ROS in PDGF Signaling}
    \label{subsec:ROS_signaling}
    - ROS as a second messenger in PDGF signaling

\section{Aim of the thesis}
\label{sec:Aim}
- Build tool for visual exploration of the CAD GWAS data.
- Establish a system to test the role of ROS in CAD.
