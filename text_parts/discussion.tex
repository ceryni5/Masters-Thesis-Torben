WHAT TO DISCUSS
\section{\ac{pdgf} Signaling Seems to Induce a Synthetic Shenotype in \acp{haosmc}}
- Differentiation -> conext for MMP9, CNN1. is it within the expectations, where do the expectatiosn come from, what kind of cell may we have?

\section{CellROX Green is Suitable for Assessing \ac{ros} Generation in \acp{haosmc}}

- CellROX -> Seems like we can prime the Cell for ROS generation. First line of evidence towards our hypothesis.
    - consider that taking out of the incubator might be nessecary, so maybe just priming the cells?
    - we require additional evidence
    - are these processes of biological relevance. do the concentrations make sense?

\section{The \ac{gwas} Navigator}
- We did collect a bunch of data
    - examplary work flow for checking STAT1 maybe


\section{\ac{cad} Associated Variants Enrich in Regulatory Elements of Heart, Artery \& Lung Tissue}
    - The enrichment -> do the identified tissues make sense?
        - immune cells
        - lung tissue
