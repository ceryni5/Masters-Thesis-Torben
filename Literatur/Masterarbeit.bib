  abstract = {The vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) in adult animals is a highly specialized cell whose principal function is contraction. However, this cell displays remarkable plasticity and can undergo profound changes in phenotype during repair of vascular injury, during remodeling in response to altered blood flow, or in various disease states. There has been extensive progress in recent years in our understanding of the complex mechanisms that control SMC differentiation and phenotypic plasticity, including the demonstration that epigenetic mechanisms play a critical role. In addition, recent evidence indicates that SMC phenotypic switching in adult animals involves the reactivation of embryonic stem cell pluripotency genes and that mesenchymal stem cells may be derived from SMC and/or pericytes. This review summarizes the current state of our knowledge in this field and identifies some of the key unresolved challenges and questions that we feel require further study.},

  abstract = {Smooth muscle cell (SMC) phenotypic modulation in atherosclerosis and in response to PDGF in vitro involves repression of differentiation marker genes and increases in SMC proliferation, migration, and matrix synthesis. However, SMCs within atherosclerotic plaques can also express a number of proinflammatory genes, and in cultured SMCs the inflammatory cytokine IL-1β represses SMC marker gene expression and induces inflammatory gene expression. Studies herein tested the hypothesis that IL-1β modulates SMC phenotype to a distinct inflammatory state relative to PDGF-DD. Genome-wide gene expression analysis of IL-1β- or PDGF-DD-treated SMCs revealed that although both stimuli repressed SMC differentiation marker gene expression, IL-1β distinctly induced expression of proinflammatory genes, while PDGF-DD primarily induced genes involved in cell proliferation. Promoters of inflammatory genes distinctly induced by IL-1β exhibited over-representation of NF-κB binding sites, and NF-κB inhibition in SMCs reduced IL-1β-induced upregulation of proinflammatory genes as well as repression of SMC differentiation marker genes. Interestingly, PDGF-DD-induced SMC marker gene repression was not NF-κB dependent. Finally, immunofluorescent staining of mouse atherosclerotic lesions revealed the presence of cells positive for the marker of an IL-1β-stimulated inflammatory SMC, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 20 (CCL20), but not the PDGF-DD-induced gene, regulator of G protein signaling 17 (RGS17). Results demonstrate that IL-1β- but not PDGF-DD-induced phenotypic modulation of SMC is characterized by NF-κB-dependent activation of proinflammatory genes, suggesting the existence of a distinct inflammatory SMC phenotype. In addition, studies provide evidence for the possible utility of CCL20 and RGS17 as markers of inflammatory and proliferative state SMCs within atherosclerotic plaques in vivo.},

  abstract = {Current knowledge suggests that intimal smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in native atherosclerotic plaque derive mainly from the medial arterial layer. During this process, SMCs undergo complex structural and functional changes giving rise to a broad spectrum of phenotypes. Classically, intimal SMCs are described as dedifferentiated/synthetic SMCs, a phenotype characterized by reduced expression of contractile proteins. Intimal SMCs are considered to have a beneficial role by contributing to the fibrous cap and thereby stabilizing atherosclerotic plaque. However, intimal SMCs can lose their properties to such an extent that they become hard to identify, contribute significantly to the foam cell population, and acquire inflammatory-like cell features. This review highlights mechanisms of SMC plasticity in different stages of native atherosclerotic plaque formation, their potential for monoclonal or oligoclonal expansion, as well as recent findings demonstrating the underestimated deleterious role of SMCs in this disease.},

  abstract = {Platelet-derived growth factors (PDGFs) and their receptors (PDGFRs) have served as prototypes for growth factor and receptor tyrosine kinase function for more than 25 years. Studies of PDGFs and PDGFRs in animal development have revealed roles for PDGFR-α signaling in gastrulation and in the development of the cranial and cardiac neural crest, gonads, lung, intestine, skin, CNS, and skeleton. Similarly, roles for PDGFR-β signaling have been established in blood vessel formation and early hematopoiesis. PDGF signaling is implicated in a range of diseases. Autocrine activation of PDGF signaling pathways is involved in certain gliomas, sarcomas, and leukemias. Paracrine PDGF signaling is commonly observed in epithelial cancers, where it triggers stromal recruitment and may be involved in epithelial–mesenchymal transition, thereby affecting tumor growth, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis. PDGFs drive pathological mesenchymal responses in vascular disorders such as atherosclerosis, restenosis, pulmonary hypertension, and retinal diseases, as well as in fibrotic diseases, including pulmonary fibrosis, liver cirrhosis, scleroderma, glomerulosclerosis, and cardiac fibrosis. We review basic aspects of the PDGF ligands and receptors, their developmental and pathological functions, principles of their pharmacological inhibition, and results using PDGF pathway-inhibitory or stimulatory drugs in preclinical and clinical contexts.},

To address relevant barriers for coronary artery disease (CAD), we combined genetic discovery analyses with downstream characterization of likely causal variants, genes, and biological pathways. Specifically, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) comprising 181,522 cases of CAD among 1,165,690 participants. We detected 241 associations, including 54 associations and 30 loci not previously linked to CAD. Next, we prioritized likely causal variants using functionally-informed fine-mapping, yielding 42 associations with fewer than five variants in the 95\% credible set. Combining eight complementary predictors, we prioritized 185 candidate causal genes, including 94 genes supported by three or more predictors. Similarity-based clustering underscored a role for early developmental processes, cell cycle signaling, and vascular proliferation in the pathogenesis of CAD. Our analysis identifies and systematically characterizes risk loci for CAD to inform experimental interrogation of putative causal mechanisms for CAD.},

  abstract = {Background: Lung function, assessed by forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC), is inversely associated with coronary artery disease (CAD), but these associations could be because of confounding or reversed causality. We conducted a 2-sample Mendelian randomization study, using publicly available data from relevant genome-wide association studies, to examine the role of FEV1 or FVC on CAD. Methods: We used the most recent genome-wide association studies on lung function to extract genetic instruments related to FEV1 and FVC (n=92\,749). Data on the association between genetic instruments and CAD were obtained from Coronary Artery Disease Genome wide Replication and Meta-analysis plus The Coronary Artery Disease Genetics 1000 Genomes-based genome-wide association studies (60\,801 CAD cases and 123\,504 controls). We used inverse-variance weighting with a multiplicative random effect to estimate the genetic instrumented association of FEV1 and FVC on CAD. Sensitivity analyses included weighted median and MR-Egger methods. Results: Each SD greater FEV1 was associated with a lower risk of CAD (odds ratio, 0.78 per SD; 95\% confidence interval, 0.62–0.98) with a similar magnitude for FVC on CAD risk (odds ratio, 0.82 per SD; 95\% confidence interval, 0.64–1.06). Estimates for FEV1 were similar when using MR-Egger method (odds ratio, 0.80 per SD; 95\% confidence interval, 0.33–1.94) although the magnitude was smaller for weighted median method (odds ratio, 0.93 per SD; 95\% confidence interval, 0.75–1.17). Estimates for FVC in the sensitivity analyses were attenuated (median) or changed direction (MR-Egger). Conclusions: Our study suggested an inverse relation between FEV1 and CAD, but for FVC, evidence is less clear.},

  abstract = {The Notch signaling pathway is a highly conserved pathway involved in cell fate determination in embryonic development and also functions in the regulation of physiological processes in several systems. It plays an especially important role in vascular development and physiology by influencing angiogenesis, vessel patterning, arterial/venous specification, and vascular smooth muscle biology. Aberrant or dysregulated Notch signaling is the cause of or a contributing factor to many vascular disorders, including inherited vascular diseases, such as cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy, associated with degeneration of the smooth muscle layer in cerebral arteries. Like most signaling pathways, the Notch signaling axis is influenced by complex interactions with mediators of other signaling pathways. This complexity is also compounded by different members of the Notch family having both overlapping and unique functions. Thus, it is vital to fully understand the roles and interactions of each Notch family member in order to effectively and specifically target their exact contributions to vascular disease. In this chapter, we will review the Notch signaling pathway in vascular smooth muscle cells as it relates to vascular development and human disease.},

  abstract = {The historical view of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in atherosclerosis is that ‘aberrant’ proliferation of VSMCs promotes plaque formation, but that VSMCs in advanced plaques are entirely beneficial, for example preventing rupture of the fibrous cap. However, this view has been based on ideas that there is a homogenous population of VSMCs within the plaque, that can be identified separate from other plaque cells (particularly macrophages) using standard VSMC and macrophage immunohistochemical ‘markers’. More recent genetic lineage tracing studies have shown that VSMC phenotypic switching results in less differentiated forms that lack VSMC ‘markers’ including macrophage-like cells, and this switching directly promotes atherosclerosis. In addition, VSMC proliferation may be beneficial throughout atherogenesis, and not just in advanced lesions, whereas VSMC apoptosis, cell senescence, and VSMC-derived macrophage-like cells may promote inflammation. We review the effect of embryological origin on VSMC behavior in atherosclerosis, the role, regulation and consequences of phenotypic switching, the evidence for different origins of VSMCs, and the role of individual processes that VSMCs undergo in atherosclerosis in regard to plaque formation and the structure of advanced lesions. We believe there is now compelling evidence that a full understanding of VSMC behavior in atherosclerosis is critical to identifying therapeutic targets to both prevent and treat atherosclerosis.},

However, details of spatiotemporal organization of specific signaling pathways that H2O2 is involved in are currently missing. Here, we use single nanoparticle imaging to measure the local H2O2 concentration and reveal regulation of the ROS response dynamics and organization to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) signaling. We demonstrate that H2O2 production is controlled by PDGFR kinase activity and EGFR transactivation, requires a persistent stimulation, and is regulated by membrane receptor diffusion. This temporal filtering is impaired in cancer cells, which may determine their pathological migration. H2O2 subcellular mapping reveals that an external PDGF gradient induces an amplification-free asymmetric H2O2 concentration profile. These results support a general model for the control of signal transduction based only on membrane receptor diffusion and second messenger degradation.},

  abstract = {Arteriosclerosis causes significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Central to this process is the development of subclinical non-atherosclerotic intimal lesions before the appearance of pathologic intimal thickening and advanced atherosclerotic plaques. Intimal thickening is associated with several risk factors, including oxidative stress due to reactive oxygen species (ROS), inflammatory cytokines and lipid. The main ROS producing systems in-vivo are reduced nicotinamide dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX). ROS effects are context specific. Exogenous ROS induces apoptosis and senescence, whereas intracellular ROS promotes stem cell differentiation, proliferation, and migration. Lineage tracing studies using murine models of subclinical atherosclerosis have revealed the contributory role of medial smooth muscle cells (SMCs), resident vascular stem cells, circulating bone-marrow progenitors and endothelial cells that undergo endothelial-mesenchymal-transition (EndMT). This review will address the putative physiological and patho-physiological roles of ROS in controlling vascular cell fate and ROS contribution to vascular regeneration and disease progression.},

  abstract = {Background The relationship between respiratory diseases and individual cardiovascular diseases, and the impact of cardiovascular diseases on mortality in patients with respiratory disease, are unclear. Objectives This study sought to determine the relationship between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma and interstitial lung disease (ILD), and individual cardiovascular diseases, and evaluate the impact of individual cardiovascular diseases on all-cause mortality in respiratory conditions. Methods The authors conducted a cohort study of all patients admitted to 7 National Health Service hospitals across the North West of England, between January 1, 2000, and March 31, 2013, with relevant respiratory diagnoses, with age-matched and sex-matched control groups. Results A total of 31,646 COPD, 60,424 asthma, and 1,662 ILD patients were included. Control groups comprised 158,230, 302,120, and 8,310 patients, respectively (total follow-up 2,968,182 patient-years). COPD was independently associated with ischemic heart disease (IHD), heart failure (HF), atrial fibrillation, and peripheral vascular disease, all of which were associated with all-cause mortality (e.g., odds ratio for the association of COPD with HF: 2.18 [95\% confidence interval (CI): 2.08 to 2.26]; hazard ratio for the contribution of HF to mortality in COPD: 1.65 [95\% CI: 1.61 to 1.68]). Asthma was independently associated with IHD, and multiple cardiovascular diseases contributed to mortality (e.g., HF hazard ratio: 1.81 [95\% CI: 1.75 to 1.87]). ILD was independently associated with IHD and HF, both of which were associated with mortality. Patients with lung disease were less likely to receive coronary revascularization. Conclusions Lung disease is independently associated with cardiovascular diseases, particularly IHD and HF, which contribute significantly to all-cause mortality. However, patients with lung disease are less likely to receive coronary revascularization.},

  abstract = {In the postnatal vasculature, fully differentiated and quiescent vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in a “contractile” phenotype are required for the normal regulation of vascular tone. The transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily of growth factors (TGF-βs and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs)) are potent inducers of contractile phenotype and mediate (i) induction of contractile genes, and (ii) inhibition of VSMC growth and migration. Transcription of contractile genes is positively regulated by a regulatory DNA element called a CArG box. The CArG box is activated by the binding of serum response factor and its coactivators, myocardin (Myocd) or Myocd-related transcription factors (MRTFs). Krüppel-like factor-4 (KLF4) is known to inhibit activation of the CArG box. However, the potential role of KLF4 in the contractile activities of TGF-β or BMP has not been explored. Here, we demonstrate that TGF-β and BMP4 rapidly down-regulate KLF4 through induction of microRNA-143 (miR-143) and miR-145, which leads to a reduction of KLF4 transcripts and decreased KLF4 protein expression. Inhibition of miR-145 prevents down-regulation of KLF4 and activation of contractile genes by TGF-β or BMP4, suggesting that modulation of KLF4 is a prerequisite for induction of contractile genes by TGF-β and BMP4. Interestingly, both TGF-β and BMP4 activate transcription of the miR-143/145 gene cluster through the CArG box, however, TGF-β mediates this effect through induction of Myocd expression, whereas BMP4 utilizes nuclear translocation of MRTF-A. Thus, this study sheds light on both the similarities and the differences of TGF-β and BMP4 signaling in the regulation of KLF4 and contractile genes.},

  abstract = {There is clear evidence that the phenotypic modulation of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) contributes to the pathophysiology of vascular disease. Phenotypic modulation refers to the unique ability of SMCs to alter their phenotype in response to extracellular stimuli and is hallmarked by the loss of SMC marker gene expression. The transcription factor Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) is a known powerful negative regulator of SMC marker gene expression that works, in part, by decreasing the expression of the serum response factor (SRF) myocardin. KLF4 is not expressed in healthy adult SMCs but is increased in SMCs in response to vascular injury in vivo or PDGF-BB treatment in vitro. The aim of the present study was to determine the molecular mechanisms that regulate the expression of KLF4 in phenotypically modulated SMCs. The results demonstrated that the transcription factor stimulating protein-1 (Sp1) regulated the expression of KLF4 in SMCs. The KLF4 promoter contains three consensus Sp1 binding sites. Using a series of truncated KLF4 promoters, we showed that only fragments containing these Sp1 sites could be activated by PDGF-BB. In addition, overexpression of Sp1 alone was sufficient to increase the activity of the KLF4 promoter. Moreover, inhibiting Sp1 expression with small-interfering RNA attenuated the effects of PDGF-BB on KLF4 expression. Mutation of the three Sp1 sites within the KLF4 promoter abolished both baseline and PDGF-BB-induced activity. Finally, the results demonstrated enhanced Sp1 binding to the KLF4 promoter in SMCs treated with PDGF-BB in vitro and following vascular injury in vivo. Taken together, the results suggest a novel role for Sp1 in increasing the expression of KLF4 in phenotypically modulated SMCs.},

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) has been reported to cause obliteration of coronary arteries by a progressive vasculopathy that involves proliferation of medial smooth muscle cells (SMC). In this study, we report that CMV enhances the serum-induced proliferation of human coronary SMC through activation of a superoxide-generating NADPH oxidase. Exposure of SMC to CMV for 2 h was associated with an 80\% increase in NADPH oxidase. This increase in oxidase activity was associated with a two-fold increase in serum-induced DNA synthesis (5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine incorporation) and significant interleukin-8 (IL-8) production by SMC. Diphenylene iodonium, an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase, significantly inhibited CMV-induced IL-8 production and promotion of serum-induced DNA synthesis. Similar effects were seen following pretreatment of SMC with N-acetyl cysteine, a potent antioxidant, suggesting that oxidative stress following CMV exposure might be responsible for triggering the proliferation of SMC. From this study, we conclude that CMV-mediated promotion of SMC growth is redox sensitive and may be mediated by NADPH oxidase.},

The interactions between the main cellular sources of ROS, such as mitochondria and NADPH oxidases, however, remain obscure. This work summarizes the latest findings on the role of cross talk between mitochondria and NADPH oxidases in pathophysiological processes. Mitochondria have the highest levels of antioxidants in the cell and play an important role in the maintenance of cellular redox status, thereby acting as an ROS and redox sink and limiting NADPH oxidase activity. Mitochondria, however, are not only a target for ROS produced by NADPH oxidase but also a significant source of ROS, which under certain conditions may stimulate NADPH oxidases. This cross talk between mitochondria and NADPH oxidases, therefore, may represent a feed-forward vicious cycle of ROS production, which can be pharmacologically targeted under conditions of oxidative stress. It has been demonstrated that mitochondria-targeted antioxidants break this vicious cycle, inhibiting ROS production by mitochondria and reducing NADPH oxidase activity. This may provide a novel strategy for treatment of many pathological conditions including aging, atherosclerosis, diabetes, hypertension, and degenerative neurological disorders in which mitochondrial oxidative stress seems to play a role. It is conceivable that the use of mitochondria-targeted treatments would be effective in these conditions.},

The transcriptional profiles of single VSMCs consistently reflect their region-specific developmental history and show heterogeneous expression of vascular disease-associated genes involved in inflammation, adhesion and migration. We detect a rare population of VSMC-lineage cells that express the multipotent progenitor marker Sca1, progressively downregulate contractile VSMC genes and upregulate genes associated with VSMC response to inflammation and growth factors. We find that Sca1 upregulation is a hallmark of VSMCs undergoing phenotypic switching in vitro and in vivo, and reveal an equivalent population of Sca1-positive VSMC-lineage cells in atherosclerotic plaques. Together, our analyses identify disease-relevant transcriptional signatures in VSMC-lineage cells in healthy blood vessels, with implications for disease susceptibility, diagnosis and prevention.},

It has been reported to lower endogenous oxidant levels and to protect cells against a wide range of pro-oxidative insults. As NAC itself is a poor scavenger of oxidants, the molecular mechanisms behind the antioxidative effects of NAC have remained uncertain. Here we show that NAC-derived cysteine is desulfurated to generate hydrogen sulfide, which in turn is oxidized to sulfane sulfur species, predominantly within mitochondria. We provide evidence suggesting the possibility that sulfane sulfur species produced by 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase and sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase are the actual mediators of the immediate antioxidative and cytoprotective effects provided by NAC.},

  abstract = {Dysregulated extracellular matrix (ECM) metabolism may contribute to vascular remodeling during the development and complication of human atherosclerotic lesions. We investigated the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a family of enzymes that degrade ECM components in human atherosclerotic plaques (n = 30) and in uninvolved arterial specimens (n = 11). We studied members of all three MMP classes (interstitial collagenase, MMP-1; gelatinases, MMP-2 and MMP-9; and stromelysin, MMP-3) and their endogenous inhibitors (TIMPs 1 and 2) by immunocytochemistry, zymography, and immunoprecipitation. Normal arteries stained uniformly for 72-kD gelatinase and TIMPs. In contrast, plaques' shoulders and regions of foam cell accumulation displayed locally increased expression of 92-kD gelatinase, stromelysin, and interstitial collagenase. However, the mere presence of MMP does not establish their catalytic capacity, as the zymogens lack activity, and TIMPs may block activated MMPs. All plaque extracts contained activated forms of gelatinases determined zymographically and by degradation of 3H-collagen type IV. To test directly whether atheromata actually contain active matrix-degrading enzymes in situ, we devised a method which allows the detection and microscopic localization of MMP enzymatic activity directly in tissue sections. In situ zymography revealed gelatinolytic and caseinolytic activity in frozen sections of atherosclerotic but not of uninvolved arterial tissues. The MMP inhibitors, EDTA and 1,10-phenanthroline, as well as recombinant TIMP-1, reduced these activities which colocalized with regions of increased immunoreactive MMP expression, i.e., the shoulders, core, and microvasculature of the plaques. Focal overexpression of activated MMP may promote destabilization and complication of atherosclerotic plaques and provide novel targets for therapeutic intervention.},

Disturbed TGF-β signaling can also cause nonhereditary disorders like atherosclerosis and cardiac fibrosis. Accordingly, cell culture studies using endothelial cells or smooth muscle cells (SMCs), cultured alone or together in two- or three-dimensional cell culture assays, on plastic or embedded in matrix, have shown that TGF-β has a pivotal effect on endothelial and SMC proliferation, differentiation, migration, tube formation, and sprouting. Moreover, TGF-β can stimulate endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition, a process shown to be of key importance in heart valve cushion formation and in various pathological vascular processes. Here, we discuss the roles of TGF-β in vasculogenesis, angiogenesis, and lymphangiogenesis and the deregulation of TGF-β signaling in cardiovascular diseases.},

  abstract = {The abilities of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I) to regulate cAMP metabolism and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) activity were compared in human arterial smooth muscle cells (hSMC). PDGF-BB stimulated cAMP accumulation up to 150-fold in a concentration-dependent manner (EC50 approximately 0.7 nM). The peak of cAMP formation and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) activity occurred approximately 5 min after the addition of PDGF and rapidly declined thereafter. Incubating cells with PDGF and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor) enhanced the accumulation of cAMP and PKA activity by an additional 2.5-3-fold, whereas IBMX alone was essentially without effect. The PDGF-stimulated increase in cAMP was prevented by addition of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin, consistent with release of prostaglandins stimulating cAMP. PDGF, but not IGF-I, stimulated MAPK activity, cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) phosphorylation, and cAMP synthesis which indicated a key role for MAP kinase in the activation of cPLA2. Further, PDGF stimulated the rapid release of arachidonic acid and synthesis of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) which could be inhibited by a cPLA2 inhibitor (AACOCF3). Calcium mobilization was required for PDGF-induced arachidonic acid release and PGE2 synthesis but not for MAPK activation, whereas PKC was required for PGE2-mediated activation of PKA. In summary, these results demonstrated that PDGF increases cAMP formation and PKA activity through a MAP kinase-mediated activation of cPLA2, arachidonic acid release, and PGE2 synthesis in human arterial smooth muscle cells.},

  abstract = {Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) are key participants in both early and late-stage atherosclerosis. VSMCs invade the early atherosclerotic lesion from the media, expanding lesions, but also forming a protective fibrous cap rich in extracellular matrix to cover the ‘necrotic’ core. Hence, VSMCs have been viewed as plaque-stabilizing, and decreased VSMC plaque content—often measured by expression of contractile markers—associated with increased plaque vulnerability. However, the emergence of lineage-tracing and transcriptomic studies has demonstrated that VSMCs comprise a much larger proportion of atherosclerotic plaques than originally thought, demonstrate multiple different phenotypes in vivo, and have roles that might be detrimental. VSMCs down-regulate contractile markers during atherosclerosis whilst adopting alternative phenotypes, including macrophage-like, foam cell-like, osteochondrogenic-like, myofibroblast-like, and mesenchymal stem cell-like. VSMC phenotypic switching can be studied in tissue culture, but also now in the media, fibrous cap and deep-core region, and markedly affects plaque formation and markers of stability. In this review, we describe the different VSMC plaque phenotypes and their presumed cellular and paracrine functions, the regulatory mechanisms that control VSMC plasticity, and their impact on atherogenesis and plaque stability.},

  abstract = {Rationale: Vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) phenotypic modulation and vascular remodeling contribute to the development of several vascular disorders such as restenosis after angioplasty, transplant vasculopathy, and atherosclerosis. The mechanisms underlying these processes, however, remain largely unknown. Objective: The objective of this study is to determine the role of dedicator of cytokinesis 2 (DOCK2) in SMC phenotypic modulation and vascular remodeling. Methods and Results: Platelet-derived growth factor-BB induced DOCK2 expression while modulating SMC phenotype. DOCK2 deficiency diminishes platelet-derived growth factor-BB or serum-induced downregulation of SMC markers. Conversely, DOCK2 overexpression inhibits SMC marker expression in primary cultured SMC. Mechanistically, DOCK2 inhibits myocardin expression, blocks serum response factor nuclear location, attenuates myocardin binding to serum response factor, and thus attenuates myocardin-induced smooth muscle marker promoter activity. Moreover, DOCK2 and Kruppel-like factor 4 cooperatively inhibit myocardin–serum response factor interaction. In a rat carotid artery balloon-injury model, DOCK2 is induced in media layer SMC initially and neointima SMC subsequently after vascular injury. Knockdown of DOCK2 dramatically inhibits the neointima formation by 60\%. Most importantly, knockout of DOCK2 in mice markedly blocks ligation-induced intimal hyperplasia while restoring SMC contractile protein expression. Conclusions: Our studies identified DOCK2 as a novel regulator for SMC phenotypic modulation and vascular lesion formation after vascular injury. Therefore, targeting DOCK2 may be a potential therapeutic strategy for the prevention of vascular remodeling in proliferative vascular diseases.},

Pulmonary vascular abnormalities are frequently present in patients with respiratory disorders, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, sarcoidosis, neuromuscular or chest wall disorders, and disorders of ventilatory control including sleep apnea syndromes and obesity hypoventilation syndrome. Pulmonary hypertension, classified as group III in the World Health Organization classification scheme for pulmonary hypertension, may result in severe right ventricular dysfunction caused by lung disease, also known as cor pulmonale. The development of cor pulmonale is generally associated with poorer prognosis and increased death. Systemic manifestations of lung disease, particularly obstructive disorders, are also particularly relevant because they are associated with increased cardiac death and impaired health status. This article will discuss the most common pulmonary diseases and disorders of ventilatory control that cause pulmonary vascular abnormalities and cor pulmonale, with particular concentration on how treatment of these diseases may affect the heart. In addition, the complex nature of cardiac and lung disease will also be explored, particularly with respect to the relationship between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, systemic inflammation, atherosclerosis, and cardiovascular death, which is currently a very active focus of research.},

Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) play a key role in atherogenesis and have historically been considered beneficial for plaque stability. VSMCs constitute the main cellular component of the protective fibrous cap within lesions and are responsible for synthesising strength‐giving extracellular matrix components. However, lineage‐tracing experiments in mouse models of atherosclerosis have shown that, in addition to the fibrous cap, VSMCs also give rise to many of the cell types found within the plaque core. In particular, VSMCs generate a substantial fraction of lipid‐laden foam cells, and VSMC‐derived cells expressing markers of macrophages, osteochondrocyte, and mesenchymal stem cells have been observed within lesions. Here, we review recent studies that have changed our perspective on VSMC function in atherosclerosis and discuss how VSMCs could be targeted to increase plaque stability.},

Here we present a new mouse model of atherosclerosis with an activating mutation in PDGFRβ. Increased PDGFRβ signalling induces chemokine secretion and leads to leukocyte accumulation in the adventitia and media of the aorta. Furthermore, PDGFRβD849V amplifies and accelerates atherosclerosis in hypercholesterolemic ApoE−/− or Ldlr−/− mice. Intriguingly, increased PDGFRβ signalling promotes advanced plaque formation at novel sites in the thoracic aorta and coronary arteries. However, deletion of the PDGFRβ-activated transcription factor STAT1 in VSMCs alleviates inflammation of the arterial wall and reduces plaque burden. These results demonstrate that PDGFRβ pathway activation has a profound effect on vascular disease and support the conclusion that inflammation in the outer arterial layers is a driving process for atherosclerosis.},

  abstract = {The real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) is probably the most common molecular technique in use today, having become the method of choice for nucleic acid detection and quantification and underpinning applications ranging from basic research through biotechnology and forensic applications to clinical diagnostics. This key technology relies on fluorescence to detect and quantify nucleic acid amplification products, and its homogeneous assay format has transformed legacy polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from a low-throughput qualitative gel-based technique to a frequently automated, rapid, high-throughput quantitative technology. However, the enormous range of protocols together with frequently inappropriate pre-assay conditions, poor assay design and unsuitable data analysis methodologies are impeding its status as a mature, ‘gold standard’ technology. This, combined with inconsistent and insufficient reporting procedures, has resulted in the widespread publication of data that can be misleading, in particular when this technology is used to quantify cellular mRNA or miRNA levels by RT-qPCR. This affects the integrity of the scientific literature, with consequences for not only basic research, but with potentially major implications for the potential development of molecular diagnostic and prognostic monitoring tools. These issues have been addressed by a set of guidelines that propose a minimum standard for the provision of information for qPCR experiments (‘MIQE’). MIQE aims to systematise current variable qPCR methods into a more consistent format that will encourage detailed auditing of experimental detail, data analysis and reporting principles. General implementation of these guidelines is an important requisite for the maturing of qPCR into a robust, accurate and reliable nucleic acid quantification technology.},

  abstract = {Over 40 years of studies on platelet-derived growth factors (PDGFs) and their receptors, the molecular mechanisms and functional roles of PDGFs in the development of embryos and human diseases, especially in cancer, are gradually being unravelled. PDGF-BB was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for promoting wound healing, while imatinib, which selectively inhibits tyrosine kinase activity of PDGF receptors (PDGFR), has been prescribed to treat patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumor and chronic eosinophilic leukaemia. However, much less often have these drugs been studied in relation to cardiovascular diseases. This brief review mainly describes the role of PDGF signalling in cardiovascular pathogenesis such as atherosclerosis, pulmonary arterial hypertension, diabetes, angiogenesis and inflammation with an emphasis on how PDGFs function in these situations and what components might serve as potential therapeutic targets against cardio-metabolic dysfunction.},

  abstract = {Atherosclerosis underlies most cardiovascular diseases, and is accepted as a primary cause of mortality worldwide. Proteases have been implicated in the development and progression of atherosclerosis, due to their ability to provoke focal destruction of the vascular extracellular matrix. Members of the metalloproteinase family, especially matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and their endogenous tissue inhibitors (TIMPs) have been suggested to perform complex dual roles during late-stage progression and rupture of atherosclerotic plaques. Proposed favourable actions of metalloproteinases include the promotion of vascular smooth muscle growth and survival which stabilises plaques, while conversely extracellular matrix destruction alongside interminable monocyte/macrophage accumulation can encourage plaque rupture. This review provides a summary of the cogent evidence connecting the contribution of individual metalloproteinases to atherosclerotic plaque development, progression, and instability. Topics discussed include structural, functional and cell-specific diversity of MMP members; evidence from animal models of atherosclerosis and comparisons with findings in humans; the dual role of MMPs and the requirement to selectively target individual MMPs; and the need for efficient surrogate markers of MMP inhibition. Accordingly, as our knowledge of the complex roles individual MMPs play especially during the progression and rupture of atherosclerotic plaques expands, new impetus is required for clinical trials evaluating the therapeutic potential of selective MMP inhibition, which could limit cardiovascular morbidity and mortality worldwide.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND. The identification of patients with high-risk atherosclerotic plaques prior to the manifestation of clinical events remains challenging. Recent findings question histology- and imaging-based definitions of the “vulnerable plaque,” necessitating an improved approach for predicting onset of symptoms., METHODS. We performed a proteomics comparison of the vascular extracellular matrix and associated molecules in human carotid endarterectomy specimens from 6 symptomatic versus 6 asymptomatic patients to identify a protein signature for high-risk atherosclerotic plaques. Proteomics data were integrated with gene expression profiling of 121 carotid endarterectomies and an analysis of protein secretion by lipid-loaded human vascular smooth muscle cells. Finally, epidemiological validation of candidate biomarkers was performed in two community-based studies., RESULTS. Proteomics and at least one of the other two approaches identified a molecular signature of plaques from symptomatic patients that comprised matrix metalloproteinase 9, chitinase 3-like-1, S100 calcium binding protein A8 (S100A8), S100A9, cathepsin B, fibronectin, and galectin-3-binding protein. Biomarker candidates measured in 685 subjects in the Bruneck study were associated with progression to advanced atherosclerosis and incidence of cardiovascular disease over a 10-year follow-up period. A 4-biomarker signature (matrix metalloproteinase 9, S100A8/S100A9, cathepsin D, and galectin-3-binding protein) improved risk prediction and was successfully replicated in an independent cohort, the SAPHIR study., CONCLUSION. The identified 4-biomarker signature may improve risk prediction and diagnostics for the management of cardiovascular disease. Further, our study highlights the strength of tissue-based proteomics for biomarker discovery., FUNDING.

  abstract = {Previously, we demonstrated that signal transducer and activator of transcription factor 1 (STAT1) plays an essential role in liver injury induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/d-galactosamine (d-GalN); however, the underlying mechanism involved remains unclear. Here, we showed that LPS/d-GalN administration induced secretion of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and interferon γ (IFN-γ), which mediated apoptosis synergistically. Moreover, LPS/d-GalN-induced apoptosis was associated with increased inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and nitric oxide (NO) production, as well as elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which were all strongly inhibited by treatment with the antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) and an iNOS/NO inhibitor, l-NMMA. Although STAT1 activation and expression did not change significantly in TNF-α/IFN-γ-cotreated cells compared with cells treated with IFN-γ alone, the absence of STAT1 or interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) in genetic knockout mice strongly abrogated the observed effects of TNF-α/IFN-γ on iNOS/NO induction, ROS production, loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ΔΨm), and apoptosis compared with STAT1(+/+) and IRF-1(+/+) mice. Additionally, the synergistic effects of TNF-α/IFN-γ on iNOS/NO induction, ROS production, and apoptosis were significantly inhibited by overexpression of dominant negative STAT1 in contrast to overexpression of wild-type STAT1. In STAT1-deficient mice, nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activation by TNF-α/IFN-γ was attenuated and strongly inhibited by both NAC and l-NMMA. Moreover, the proteasome inhibitor, MG132, inhibited NF-κB activation and strongly inhibited iNOS/NO induction, ROS production, and loss of ΔΨm induced by TNF-α/IFN-γ, thereby inhibiting apoptosis. Interestingly, it appears peroxynitrite, which is produced by TNF-α/IFN-γ, may interfere with STAT1 phosphorylation by inducing STAT1 nitration. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that TNF-α/IFN-γ synergistically potentiates iNOS/NO induction, ROS production, and loss of ΔΨm via STAT1 overexpression, playing an important role in promoting apoptosis and liver injury induced by LPS/d-GalN.},

In the past decade, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified tens of thousands of genetic loci associated with various diseases. Since the majority of such loci lie within non-coding regions and have many candidate variants in linkage disequilibrium, it has been challenging to accurately identify specific causal variants and genes. To aid in their discovery a variety of statistical and experimental approaches have been developed. These approaches often borrow information from functional genomics assays such as ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq and RNA-seq to annotate functional variants and identify regulatory relationships between variants and genes. While such approaches are powerful, given the diversity of cell types and environments, it is paramount to select disease-relevant contexts for follow-up analyses. In this review, we discuss the latest developments, challenges, and best practices for determining the causal mechanisms of polygenic disease risk variants with functional genomics data from specialized cell types.},

Moreover, previous studies have demonstrated that the Kruppel-like transcription factor (KLF) 4 potently represses the expression of multiple SMC genes. However, the mechanisms whereby KLF4 suppresses SMC gene expression are not known, nor is it clear whether KLF4 contributes to PDGF-BB-induced down-regulation of SMC genes. The goals of the present studies were to determine the molecular mechanisms by which KLF4 represses expression of SMC genes and whether it contributes to PDGF-BB-induced suppression of these genes. Results demonstrated that KLF4 markedly repressed both myocardin-induced activation of SMC genes and expression of myocardin. KLF4 was rapidly up-regulated in PDGF-BB-treated, cultured SMC, and a small interfering RNA to KLF4 partially blocked PDGF-BB-induced SMC gene repression. Both PDGF-BB and KLF4 markedly reduced serum response factor binding to CArG containing regions within intact chromatin. Finally, KLF4, which is normally not expressed in differentiated SMC in \emph{vivo}, was rapidly up-regulated \emph{in vivo} in response to vascular injury. Taken together, results indicate that KLF4 represses SMC genes by both down-regulating myocardin expression and preventing serum response factor/myocardin from associating with SMC gene promoters, and suggest that KLF4 may be a key effector of PDGF-BB and injury-induced phenotypic switching of SMC.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

SMC also participate in physiological and pathological vascular remodeling due to their remarkable ability to dynamically modulate their phenotype. During the past decade, the development of in vivo fate mapping systems for unbiased identification and tracking of SMC and their progeny has led to major discoveries as well as the reevaluation of well-established concepts about the contribution of vascular SMC in major vascular diseases including atherosclerosis. Lineage tracing studies revealed that SMC undergoes multiple phenotypic transitions characterized by the expression of markers of alternative cell types (eg, macrophage-like and mesenchymal-stem cell-like) and populate injured or diseased vessels by oligoclonal expansion of a limited number of medial SMC. With the development of high-throughput transcriptomics and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq), the field is moving forward towards in-depth SMC phenotypic characterization. Herein, we review the major observations put forth by lineage and clonality tracing studies and the evidence in support for SMC phenotypic diversity in healthy and diseased vascular tissue. We will also discuss the opportunities and remaining challenges of combining lineage tracing and single-cell transcriptomics technologies, as well as studying the functional relevance of SMC phenotypic transitions and identifying the mechanisms controlling them.},

  abstract = {Background— Myocardin (Myocd) is a strong coactivator that binds the serum response factor (SRF) transcription factor over CArG elements embedded within smooth muscle cell (SMC) and cardiac muscle cyto-contractile genes. Here, we sought to ascertain whether Myocd-mediated gene expression confers a structural and physiological cardiac or SMC phenotype. Methods and Results— Adenoviral-mediated expression of Myocd in the BC3H1 cell line induces cardiac and SMC genes while suppressing both skeletal muscle markers and cell growth. Immunofluorescence microscopy shows that SRF and a SMC-like cyto-contractile apparatus are elevated with Myocd overexpression. A short hairpin RNA to Srf impairs BC3H1 cyto-architecture; however, cotransduction with Myocd results in complete restoration of the cyto-architecture. Electron microscopic studies demonstrate a SMC ultrastructural phenotype with no evidence for cardiac sarcomerogenesis. Biochemical and time-lapsed videomicroscopy assays reveal clear evidence for Myocd-induced SMC-like contraction. Conclusion— Myocd is sufficient for the establishment of a SMC-like contractile phenotype.},

  abstract = {The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor characterized to play a role in detection and adaptation to environmental stimuli. Genetic deletion of the AhR results in cardiac hypertrophy that is mediated primarily by endothelin-1 (ET-1); ET-1 has been implicated in the elevation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the heart, which are thought to contribute to several cardiovascular disorders, including cardiac hypertrophy. Thus, we tested the novel hypothesis that ET-1 induces ROS in AhR null mice via ETA receptor activation. We first confirmed the presence of ROS in the hearts of AhR null mice by measuring superoxide (\textbackslash batchmode \textbackslash documentclass[fleqn,10pt,legalpaper]\{article\} \textbackslash usepackage\{amssymb\} \textbackslash usepackage\{amsfonts\} \textbackslash usepackage\{amsmath\} \textbackslash pagestyle\{empty\} \textbackslash begin\{document\} \textbackslash (\textbackslash mathrm\{O\}\_\{2\}\^\{\{\textbackslash bullet\}\{-\}\}\textbackslash ) \textbackslash end\{document\})-dependent oxidation of dihydroethidium. Ethidium fluorescence was increased 10-fold in the hearts of AhR null mice, compared to the wild type. Then, to elucidate whether ET-1 mediated the increase in ROS, mice were chronically treated with 100 ng/kg/day of the ETA receptor antagonist BQ-123. In AhR null mice, BQ-123 significantly reduced elevated plasma 8-isoprostane, a systemic end product of phospholipid oxidation by ROS, and cardiac thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), a nonspecific assessment of ROS production. Furthermore, BQ-123 reduced both cardiac lucigenin chemiluminescence and cardiac mRNA expression of NAD(P)H oxidase subunits gp91phox, p47phox, and p67phox in AhR null mice below the levels observed in wild-type mice. These findings demonstrate that ET-1 activation of ETA receptors mediates an increase in ROS that is associated with cardiac hypertrophy in AhR null mice. In addition, the ET-1–mediated increase in ROS appears to be initiated via increased NAD(P)H oxidase activity.},

  abstract = {Humans have long pondered the nature of their mind/brain and, particularly why its capacities for reasoning, communication and abstract thought are far superior to other species, including closely related anthropoids. This article considers superior pattern processing (SPP) as the fundamental basis of most, if not all, unique features of the human brain including intelligence, language, imagination, invention, and the belief in imaginary entities such as ghosts and gods. SPP involves the electrochemical, neuronal network-based, encoding, integration, and transfer to other individuals of perceived or mentally-fabricated patterns. During human evolution, pattern processing capabilities became increasingly sophisticated as the result of expansion of the cerebral cortex, particularly the prefrontal cortex and regions involved in processing of images. Specific patterns, real or imagined, are reinforced by emotional experiences, indoctrination and even psychedelic drugs. Impaired or dysregulated SPP is fundamental to cognitive and psychiatric disorders. A broader understanding of SPP mechanisms, and their roles in normal and abnormal function of the human brain, may enable the development of interventions that reduce irrational decisions and destructive behaviors.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The prevalence, prognostic import, and impact of renal insufficiency on the benefits of ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers in community-dwelling patients with heart failure are uncertain. METHODS AND RESULTS: We analyzed data from a prospective cohort of 754 patients with heart failure who had ejection fraction, serum creatinine, and weight measured at baseline. Median age was 69 years, and 43\% had an ejection fraction {$>$} or =35\%. By the Cockcroft-Gault equation, 118 patients (16\%) had creatinine clearances {$<$} or =30 mL/min and 301 (40\%) had creatinine clearances between 30 and 59 mL/min. During follow-up (median 926 days), 385 patients (37\%) died. Even after adjustment for all other prognostic factors, survival was significantly associated with renal function (P=0.002) in patients with either systolic or diastolic dysfunction; patients exhibited a 1\% increase in mortality for each 1-mL/min decrease in creatinine clearance. The associations with 1-year mortality reductions were similar for ACE inhibitors (OR 0.46 [95\% CI 0.26 to 0.82] versus OR 0.28 [95\% CI 0.11 to 0.70]) and beta-blockers (OR 0.40 [95\% CI 0.23 to 0.70] versus OR 0.41 [95\% CI 0.19 to 0.85]) in patients with creatinine clearances {$<$}60 mL/min versus {$>$} or =60 mL/min, although these drugs were used less frequently in patients with renal insufficiency. CONCLUSIONS: Renal insufficiency is more prevalent in patients with heart failure than previously reported and is an independent prognostic factor in diastolic and systolic dysfunction. ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers were associated with similar reductions in mortality in patients with and without renal insufficiency.},

All data are available through the ENCODE data portal (https://www.encodeproject.org), including phase II ENCODE1 and Roadmap Epigenomics2 data. We have developed a registry of 926,535 human and 339,815 mouse candidate cis-regulatory elements, covering 7.9 and 3.4\% of their respective genomes, by integrating selected datatypes associated with gene regulation, and constructed a web-based server (SCREEN; http://screen.encodeproject.org) to provide flexible, user-defined access to this resource. Collectively, the ENCODE data and registry provide an expansive resource for the scientific community to build a better understanding of the organization and function of the human and mouse genomes.},

We integrate genetics (GWAS Catalog and UK Biobank) with transcriptomic, proteomic and epigenomic data, including systematic disease–disease and disease–molecular trait colocalization results across 92 cell types and tissues. We identify 729 loci fine mapped to a single-coding causal variant and colocalized with a single gene. We trained a machine-learning model using the fine-mapped genetics and functional genomics data and 445 gold-standard curated GWAS loci to distinguish causal genes from neighboring genes, outperforming a naive distance-based model. Our prioritized genes were enriched for known approved drug targets (odds ratio\,=\,8.1, 95\% confidence interval\,=\,5.7, 11.5). These results are publicly available through a web portal ( http://genetics.opentargets.org ), enabling users to easily prioritize genes at disease-associated loci and assess their potential as drug targets.

  abstract = {SIGNIFICANCE: There is increasing evidence that the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the central nervous system (CNS) involves the NOX family of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidases. Controlled ROS generation appears necessary for optimal functioning of the CNS through fine-tuning of redox-sensitive signaling pathways, while overshooting ROS generation will lead to oxidative stress and CNS disease. RECENT ADVANCES: NOX enzymes are not only restricted to microglia (i.e. brain phagocytes) but also expressed in neurons, astrocytes, and the neurovascular system. NOX enzymes are involved in CNS development, neural stem cell biology, and the function of mature neurons. While NOX2 appears to be a major source of pathological oxidative stress in the CNS, other NOX isoforms might also be of importance, for example, NOX4 in stroke. Globally speaking, there is now convincing evidence for a role of NOX enzymes in various neurodegenerative diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, and psychosis-related disorders. CRITICAL ISSUES: The relative importance of specific ROS sources (e.g., NOX enzymes vs. mitochondria; NOX2 vs. NOX4) in different pathological processes needs further investigation. The absence of specific inhibitors limits the possibility to investigate specific therapeutic strategies. The uncritical use of non-specific inhibitors (e.g., apocynin, diphenylene iodonium) and poorly validated antibodies may lead to misleading conclusions. FUTURE DIRECTIONS: Physiological and pathophysiological studies with cell-type-specific knock-out mice will be necessary to delineate the precise functions of NOX enzymes and their implications in pathomechanisms. The development of CNS-permeant, specific NOX inhibitors will be necessary to advance toward therapeutic applications.},

  abstract = {The focus of this review is to provide an overview of the current state of knowledge of molecular mechanisms/processes that control differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) during normal development and maturation of the vasculature, as well as how these mechanisms/processes are altered in vascular injury or disease. A major challenge in understanding differentiation of the vascular SMC is that this cell can exhibit a wide range of different phenotypes at different stages of development, and even in adult organisms the cell is not terminally differentiated. Indeed, the SMC is capable of major changes in its phenotype in response to changes in local environmental cues including growth factors/inhibitors, mechanical influences, cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, and various inflammatory mediators. There has been much progress in recent years to identify mechanisms that control expression of the repertoire of genes that are specific or selective for the vascular SMC and required for its differentiated function. One of the most exciting recent discoveries was the identification of the serum response factor (SRF) coactivator gene myocardin that appears to be required for expression of many SMC differentiation marker genes, and for initial differentiation of SMC during development. However, it is critical to recognize that overall control of SMC differentiation/maturation, and regulation of its responses to changing environmental cues, is extremely complex and involves the cooperative interaction of many factors and signaling pathways that are just beginning to be understood. There is also relatively recent evidence that circulating stem cell populations can give rise to smooth muscle-like cells in association with vascular injury and atherosclerotic lesion development, although the exact role and properties of these cells remain to be clearly elucidated. The goal of this review is to summarize the current state of our knowledge in this area and to attempt to identify some of the key unresolved challenges and questions that require further study.},

  abstract = {Background: Smooth muscle cells (SMCs) play significant roles in atherosclerosis via phenotypic switching, a pathological process in which SMC dedifferentiation, migration, and transdifferentiation into other cell types. Yet how SMCs contribute to the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis remains elusive. Methods: To reveal the trajectories of SMC transdifferentiation during atherosclerosis and to identify molecular targets for disease therapy, we combined SMC fate mapping and single-cell RNA sequencing of both mouse and human atherosclerotic plaques. We also performed cell biology experiments on isolated SMC-derived cells, conducted integrative human genomics, and used pharmacological studies targeting SMC-derived cells both in vivo and in vitro. Results: We found that SMCs transitioned to an intermediate cell state during atherosclerosis, which was also found in human atherosclerotic plaques of carotid and coronary arteries. SMC-derived intermediate cells, termed “SEM” cells (stem cell, endothelial cell, monocyte), were multipotent and could differentiate into macrophage-like and fibrochondrocyte-like cells, as well as return toward the SMC phenotype. Retinoic acid (RA) signaling was identified as a regulator of SMC to SEM cell transition, and RA signaling was dysregulated in symptomatic human atherosclerosis. Human genomics revealed enrichment of genome-wide association study signals for coronary artery disease in RA signaling target gene loci and correlation between coronary artery disease risk alleles and repressed expression of these genes. Activation of RA signaling by all-trans RA, an anticancer drug for acute promyelocytic leukemia, blocked SMC transition to SEM cells, reduced atherosclerotic burden, and promoted fibrous cap stability. Conclusions: Integration of cell-specific fate mapping, single-cell genomics, and human genetics adds novel insights into the complexity of SMC biology and reveals regulatory pathways for therapeutic targeting of SMC transitions in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.},

  abstract = {Contacts between distant genomic regions in the same or in different chromosomes are important in the regulation of gene expression, as highlighted by the activation of genes by chromatin contacts between promoters and enhancers that can lie hundreds of kb away.Chromatin contacts are currently measured by two main approaches: chromosome conformation capture (3C)-based techniques and nuclear imaging methods such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Both approaches have caveats, and the field is ripe for further technical development.The formation of chromatin contacts is promoted by chromatin-binding proteins that can bind two or more genomic regions simultaneously. Such proteins include transcription factors, RNA and DNA polymerases, Polycomb repressive complexes and chromosomal scaffold proteins such as cohesin.Topologically associating domains (TADs) are genomic regions enriched with contacts within them. TADs have specific sizes and positions in the genome and are found in a wide range of metazoans. The factors and mechanisms that promote TAD formation are a matter of considerable debate.The three-dimensional organization of the genome also depends on the formation of chromatin contacts with nuclear domains and compartments such as the nuclear lamina and the nucleolus. Specific sets of chromatin contacts are formed within each chromosome, and between them and nuclear domains. The mechanisms that govern chromosome localization, volume and shape remain poorly understood.Many cellular processes such as division, differentiation and senescence, present challenges to the maintenance of nuclear organization, gene expression programs and cell identity. At the same time, they can also offer opportunities for chromatin remodelling and the reinforcement of gene expression patterns.},

  abstract = {Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) develop a highly proliferative and synthetic phenotype in arterial diseases. Because such phenotypic changes are likely integrated with the energetic state of the cell, we hypothesized that changes in cellular metabolism regulate VSMC plasticity. VSMCs were exposed to platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF) and changes in mitochondrial morphology, proliferation, contractile protein expression, and mitochondrial metabolism were examined. Exposure of VSMCs to PDGF resulted in mitochondrial fragmentation and a 50\% decrease in the abundance of mitofusin 2. Synthetic VSMCs demonstrated a 20\% decrease in glucose oxidation, which was accompanied by an increase in fatty acid oxidation. Results of mitochondrial function assays in permeabilized cells showed few changes due to PDGF treatment in mitochondrial respiratory chain capacity and coupling. Treatment of VSMCs with Mdivi-1-an inhibitor of mitochondrial fission-inhibited PDGF-induced mitochondrial fragmentation by 50\% and abolished increases in cell proliferation; however, it failed to prevent PDGF-mediated activation of autophagy and removal of contractile proteins. In addition, treatment with Mdivi-1 reversed changes in fatty acid and glucose oxidation associated with the synthetic phenotype. These results suggest that changes in mitochondrial morphology and bioenergetics underlie the hyperproliferative features of the synthetic VSMC phenotype, but do not affect the degradation of contractile proteins. Mitochondrial fragmentation occurring during the transition to the synthetic phenotype could be a therapeutic target for hyperproliferative vascular disorders.},

  abstract = {KEY POINTS: Smooth muscle cell (SMC) phenotypic conversion from a contractile to a migratory phenotype is proposed to underlie cardiovascular disease but its contribution to vascular remodelling and even its existence have recently been questioned. Tracking the fate of individual SMCs is difficult as no specific markers of migratory SMCs exist. This study used a novel, prolonged time-lapse imaging approach to continuously track the behaviour of unambiguously identified, fully differentiated SMCs. In response to serum, highly-elongated, contractile SMCs initially rounded up, before spreading and migrating and these migratory cells displayed clear phagocytic activity. This study provides a direct demonstration of the transition of fully contractile SMCs to a non-contractile, migratory phenotype with phagocytic capacity that may act as a macrophage-like cell. ABSTRACT: Atherosclerotic plaques are populated with smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and macrophages. SMCs are thought to accumulate in plaques because fully differentiated, contractile SMCs reprogramme into a 'synthetic' migratory phenotype, so-called phenotypic modulation, whilst plaque macrophages are thought to derive from blood-borne myeloid cells. Recently, these views have been challenged, with reports that SMC phenotypic modulation may not occur during vascular remodelling and that plaque macrophages may not be of haematopoietic origin. Following the fate of SMCs is complicated by the lack of specific markers for the migratory phenotype and direct demonstrations of phenotypic modulation are lacking. Therefore, we employed long-term, high-resolution, time-lapse microscopy to track the fate of unambiguously identified, fully-differentiated, contractile SMCs in response to the growth factors present in serum. Phenotypic modulation was clearly observed. The highly elongated, contractile SMCs initially rounded up, for 1-3~days, before spreading outwards. Once spread, the SMCs became motile and displayed dynamic cell-cell communication behaviours. Significantly, they also displayed clear evidence of phagocytic activity. This macrophage-like behaviour was confirmed by their internalisation of 1~μm fluorescent latex beads. However, migratory SMCs did not uptake acetylated low-density lipoprotein or express the classic macrophage marker CD68. These results directly demonstrate that SMCs may rapidly undergo phenotypic modulation and develop phagocytic capabilities. Resident SMCs may provide a potential source of macrophages in vascular remodelling.},

  abstract = {Advancing from statistical associations of complex traits with genetic markers to understanding the functional genetic variants that influence traits is often a complex process. Fine-mapping can select and prioritize genetic variants for further study, yet the multitude of analytical strategies and study designs makes it challenging to choose an optimal approach. We review the strengths and weakness of different fine-mapping approaches, emphasizing the main factors that affect performance. Topics include interpreting results from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), the role of linkage disequilibrium, statistical fine-mapping approaches, trans-ethnic studies, genomic annotation and data integration, and other analysis and design issues., Fine-mapping is the process by which a trait-associated region from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) is analysed to identify the particular genetic variants that are likely to causally influence the examined trait. This Review discusses the diverse statistical approaches to fine mapping, their foundations, strengths and limitations, including integration of trans-ethnic human population data and functional annotations.},

  abstract = {‘Reactive oxygen species’ (ROS) is an umbrella term for an array of derivatives of molecular oxygen that occur as a normal attribute of aerobic life. Elevated formation of the different ROS leads to molecular damage, denoted as ‘oxidative distress’. Here we focus on ROS at physiological levels and their central role in redox signalling via different post-translational modifications, denoted as ‘oxidative eustress’. Two species, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and the superoxide anion radical (O2·−), are key redox signalling agents generated under the control of growth factors and cytokines by more than 40 enzymes, prominently including NADPH oxidases and the mitochondrial electron transport chain. At the low physiological levels in the nanomolar range, H2O2 is the major agent signalling through specific protein targets, which engage in metabolic regulation and stress responses to support cellular adaptation to a changing environment and stress. In addition, several other reactive species are involved in redox signalling, for instance nitric oxide, hydrogen sulfide and oxidized lipids. Recent methodological advances permit the assessment of molecular interactions of specific ROS molecules with specific targets in redox signalling pathways. Accordingly, major advances have occurred in understanding the role of these oxidants in physiology and disease, including the nervous, cardiovascular and immune systems, skeletal muscle and metabolic regulation as well as ageing and cancer. In the past, unspecific elimination of ROS by use of low molecular mass antioxidant compounds was not successful in counteracting disease initiation and progression in clinical trials. However, controlling specific ROS-mediated signalling pathways by selective targeting offers a perspective for a future of more refined redox medicine. This includes enzymatic defence systems such as those controlled by the stress-response transcription factors NRF2 and nuclear factor-κB, the role of trace elements such as selenium, the use of redox drugs and the modulation of environmental factors collectively known as the exposome (for example, nutrition, lifestyle and irradiation).},

We sought to determine the relationship between reduced FEV1 and cardiovascular mortality, independent of smoking. Design Longitudinal population-based study and a metaanalysis of literature. Setting Representative sample of the general population. Participants Participants of the first National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Epidemiologic Follow-up Study who were 40 to 60 years of age at baseline assessment (n = 1,861). Measurements and results We compared the risk of cardiovascular mortality across quintiles of FEV1. Individuals in the lowest FEV1 quintile had the highest risk of cardiovascular mortality (relative risk [RR], 3.36; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.54 to 7.34). Compared to FEV1 quintile 1, individuals in quintile 5 had a fivefold increase in the risk of death from ischemic heart disease (RR, 5.65; 95\% CI, 2.26 to 14.13). We also performed a systematic review of large cohort studies ({$>$} 500 participants) that reported on the relationship between FEV1 and cardiovascular mortality (12 studies; n = 83,880 participants). Compared to participants in the highest FEV1 category, those with reduced FEV1 had a higher risk of cardiovascular mortality (pooled RR, 1.77; 95\% CI, 1.56 to 1.97). Conclusions There is strong epidemiologic evidence to indicate that reduced FEV1 is a marker for cardiovascular mortality independent of age, gender, and smoking history.},

This article introduces linkage disequilibrium, reviews the population genetic processes that affect it and describes some of its uses. At present, linkage disequilibrium is used much more extensively in the study of humans than in non-humans, but that is changing as technological advances make extensive genomic studies feasible in other species.},

  abstract = {The pathobiology of atherosclerotic disease requires further elucidation to discover new approaches to address its high morbidity and mortality. To date, over 17 million cardiovascular-related deaths have been reported annually, despite a multitude of surgical and nonsurgical interventions and advances in medical therapy. Existing strategies to prevent disease progression mainly focus on management of risk factors, such as hypercholesterolemia. Even with optimum current medical therapy, recurrent cardiovascular events are not uncommon in patients with atherosclerosis, and their incidence can reach 10–15\% per year. Although treatments targeting inflammation are under investigation and continue to evolve, clinical breakthroughs are possible only if we deepen our understanding of vessel wall pathobiology. Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) are one of the most abundant cells in vessel walls and have emerged as key players in disease progression. New technologies, including in situ hybridization proximity ligation assays, in vivo cell fate tracing with the CreERT2-loxP system and single-cell sequencing technology with spatial resolution, broaden our understanding of the complex biology of these intriguing cells. Our knowledge of contractile and synthetic VSMC phenotype switching has expanded to include macrophage-like and even osteoblast-like VSMC phenotypes. An increasing body of data suggests that VSMCs have remarkable plasticity and play a key role in cell-to-cell crosstalk with endothelial cells and immune cells during the complex process of inflammation. These are cells that sense, interact with and influence the behavior of other cellular components of the vessel wall. It is now more obvious that VSMC plasticity and the ability to perform nonprofessional phagocytic functions are key phenomena maintaining the inflammatory state and senescent condition and actively interacting with different immune competent cells.},

  abstract = {Increased vascular production of reactive oxygen species (ROS; termed oxidative stress) has been implicated in various chronic diseases, including hypertension. Oxidative stress is both a cause and a consequence of hypertension. Although oxidative injury may not be the sole etiology, it amplifies blood pressure elevation in the presence of other pro-hypertensive factors. Oxidative stress is a multisystem phenomenon in hypertension and involves the heart, kidneys, nervous system, vessels and possibly the immune system. Compelling experimental and clinical evidence indicates the importance of the vasculature in the pathophysiology of hypertension and as such much emphasis has been placed on the (patho)biology of ROS in the vascular system. A major source for cardiovascular, renal and neural ROS is a family of non-phagocytic nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidases (Nox), including the prototypic Nox2 homolog-based NADPH oxidase, as well as other Noxes, such as Nox1 and Nox4. Nox-derived ROS is important in regulating endothelial function and vascular tone. Oxidative stress is implicated in endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, hypertrophy, apoptosis, migration, fibrosis, angiogenesis and rarefaction, important processes involved in vascular remodeling in hypertension. Despite a plethora of data implicating oxidative stress as a causative factor in experimental hypertension, findings in human hypertension are less conclusive. This review highlights the importance of ROS in vascular biology and focuses on the potential role of oxidative stress in human hypertension.},

The capillaries. The venules and veins returning blood to the heart. The function and structure of each segment of the peripheral vascular system vary depending on the organ it supplies. Aside from capillaries, blood vessels are all made of three layers:~ The adventitia or outer layer which provides structural support and shape to the vessel. The tunica media or a middle layer composed of elastic and muscular tissue which regulates the internal diameter of the vessel. The tunic intima or an inner layer consisting of an endothelial lining which provides a frictionless pathway for the movement of blood. Within each layer, the amount of muscle and collagen fibrils varies,~depending on the size and location of the vessel.~  Arteries~  Arteries play a major role in nourishing organs with blood and nutrients. Arteries are always under high pressure. To accommodate this stress, they have an abundance of elastic tissue and less smooth muscle. The presence of elastin in the large blood vessels enables these vessels to increase in size and alter their diameter. When an artery reaches a particular organ, it undergoes a further division into smaller vessels that have more smooth muscle and less elastic tissue. As the diameter of the blood vessels decreases, the velocity of blood flow also diminishes. Estimates are that about 10\% to 15\% of the total blood volume is contained in the arterial system. This feature of high systemic pressure and low volume is typical of the arterial system.~~ ~There are two main types of arteries found in the body: (1) the elastic~arteries, and (2) the muscular arteries. Muscular arteries include the anatomically named arteries like the brachial artery, the radial artery, and the femoral artery, for example. Muscular arteries contain more smooth muscle cells in the tunica media layer than the elastic arteries.~Elastic arteries are those nearest the heart (aorta and~pulmonary arteries) that contain much more elastic tissue in the tunica media than muscular arteries. This feature of the elastic arteries allows them to maintain a relatively constant pressure gradient despite the constant pumping action of the heart.~~  Arterioles~  Arterioles provide blood to the organs and are chiefly composed of smooth muscle. The autonomic nervous system influences the diameter and shape of arterioles. They respond to the tissue's need for more nutrients/oxygen. Arterioles play a significant role in the systemic vascular resistance because of the lack of significant elastic tissue in the walls.~ The arterioles vary from~8~to 60 micrometers. The arterioles further subdivide into meta-arterioles.~  Capillaries~  Capillaries are thin-walled vessels composed of a single endothelial layer. Because of the thin walls of the capillary, the exchange of nutrients and metabolites occurs primarily via diffusion. The arteriolar lumen regulates the flow of blood through the capillaries.~  Venules~  Venules are the smallest veins and receive blood from capillaries. They also play a role in the exchange of oxygen and nutrients for water products. There are post-capillary sphincters located~between the capillaries and venules. The venule is very thin-walled and easily prone to rupture with excessive volume.~  Veins~  Blood flows from venules into larger veins. Just like the arterial system, three layers make up the vein walls. But unlike the arteries, the venous pressure is low. Veins are thin-walled and are less elastic.~This feature permits the veins to~hold a very~high percentage of the blood in circulation.~The venous system can accommodate a large volume of blood at relatively low pressures, a feature termed~high capacitance. At any point in time, nearly three-fourths of the circulating blood volume is contained in the venous system. One can also find one-way valves inside veins that allow for blood flow, toward the heart,~in a forward direction.~Muscle contractions aid the blood flow in the leg veins. The forward blood flow from the lower extremities to the heart is also influenced by respiratory changes that affect pressure gradients in the abdomen and chest cavity. This pressure differential is highest during deep inspiration, but a small pressure differential is observable during the entire respiratory cycle.},

  abstract = {The peripheral vascular system (PVS) includes all the blood vessels that exist outside the heart.~The peripheral vascular system is classified~as follows: The aorta and its branches: The arterioles. The capillaries. The venules and veins returning blood to the heart. The function and structure of each segment of the peripheral vascular system vary depending on the organ it supplies. Aside from capillaries, blood vessels are all made of three layers:~ The adventitia or outer layer which provides structural support and shape to the vessel. The tunica media or a middle layer composed of elastic and muscular tissue which regulates the internal diameter of the vessel. The tunic intima or an inner layer consisting of an endothelial lining which provides a frictionless pathway for the movement of blood. Within each layer, the amount of muscle and collagen fibrils varies,~depending on the size and location of the vessel.~  Arteries~  Arteries play a major role in nourishing organs with blood and nutrients. Arteries are always under high pressure. To accommodate this stress, they have an abundance of elastic tissue and less smooth muscle. The presence of elastin in the large blood vessels enables these vessels to increase in size and alter their diameter. When an artery reaches a particular organ, it undergoes a further division into smaller vessels that have more smooth muscle and less elastic tissue. As the diameter of the blood vessels decreases, the velocity of blood flow also diminishes. Estimates are that about 10\% to 15\% of the total blood volume is contained in the arterial system. This feature of high systemic pressure and low volume is typical of the arterial system.~~ ~There are two main types of arteries found in the body: (1) the elastic~arteries, and (2) the muscular arteries. Muscular arteries include the anatomically named arteries like the brachial artery, the radial artery, and the femoral artery, for example. Muscular arteries contain more smooth muscle cells in the tunica media layer than the elastic arteries.~Elastic arteries are those nearest the heart (aorta and~pulmonary arteries) that contain much more elastic tissue in the tunica media than muscular arteries. This feature of the elastic arteries allows them to maintain a relatively constant pressure gradient despite the constant pumping action of the heart.~~  Arterioles~  Arterioles provide blood to the organs and are chiefly composed of smooth muscle. The autonomic nervous system influences the diameter and shape of arterioles. They respond to the tissue's need for more nutrients/oxygen. Arterioles play a significant role in the systemic vascular resistance because of the lack of significant elastic tissue in the walls.~ The arterioles vary from~8~to 60 micrometers. The arterioles further subdivide into meta-arterioles.~  Capillaries~  Capillaries are thin-walled vessels composed of a single endothelial layer. Because of the thin walls of the capillary, the exchange of nutrients and metabolites occurs primarily via diffusion. The arteriolar lumen regulates the flow of blood through the capillaries.~  Venules~  Venules are the smallest veins and receive blood from capillaries. They also play a role in the exchange of oxygen and nutrients for water products. There are post-capillary sphincters located~between the capillaries and venules. The venule is very thin-walled and easily prone to rupture with excessive volume.~  Veins~  Blood flows from venules into larger veins.

  abstract = {Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of mortality worldwide and poses a considerable public health burden. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed {$>$}100 genetic loci associated with CAD susceptibility in humans. While a number of these loci harbor gene targets of currently approved therapies, such as statins and PCSK9 inhibitors, the majority of the annotated genes at these loci encode for proteins involved in vessel wall function with no known drugs available. Importantly many of the associated genes linked to vascular (smooth muscle, endothelial, and macrophage) cell processes are now organized into distinct functional pathways, e.g., vasodilation, growth factor responses, extracellular matrix and plaque remodeling, and inflammation. In this mini-review, we highlight the most recently identified loci that have predicted roles in the vessel wall and provide genetic context for pre-existing therapies as well as new drug targets informed from GWAS. With the development of new modalities to target these pathways, (e.g., antisense oligonucleotides, CRISPR/Cas9, and RNA interference) as well as the computational frameworks to prioritize or reposition therapeutics, there is great opportunity to close the gap from initial genetic discovery to clinical translation for many patients affected by this common disease.},

  abstract = {Smooth muscle cells switch between differentiated and proliferative phenotypes in response to extracellular cues1, but the transcriptional mechanisms that confer such phenotypic plasticity remain unclear. Serum response factor (SRF) activates genes involved in smooth muscle differentiation and proliferation by recruiting muscle-restricted cofactors, such as the transcriptional coactivator myocardin, and ternary complex factors (TCFs) of the ETS-domain family, respectively2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Here we show that growth signals repress smooth muscle genes by triggering the displacement of myocardin from SRF by Elk-1, a TCF that acts as a myogenic repressor. The opposing influences of myocardin and Elk-1 on smooth muscle gene expression are mediated by structurally related SRF-binding motifs that compete for a common docking site on SRF. A mutant smooth muscle promoter, retaining responsiveness to myocardin and SRF but defective in TCF binding, directs ectopic transcription in the embryonic heart, demonstrating a role for TCFs in suppression of smooth muscle gene expression in vivo. We conclude that growth and developmental signals modulate smooth muscle gene expression by regulating the association of SRF with antagonistic cofactors.},

Interferon (IFN) administration increases cancer cell apoptosis via STAT activation and ROS accumulation. However, the existence of a STAT-ROS cycle and how it affects IFN‑induced cancer cellular apoptosis are unclear. In the present study, we used MCF7 breast cancer cells and confirmed that a combination of IFN‑α/β/γ incubation induced STAT1/3 phosphorylation and mitochondria importation, which increased mitochondria respiratory complexes, the cellular oxygen consumption rate (OCR), and ROS production, followed by cellular apoptosis. We also found that STAT1/3 overexpression induced mitochondria respiratory complexes and ROS production. Additionally, ROS induced by H2O2 induced phosphorylation of STAT1/3 and promoted mitochondria importation. STAT1/3 deletion suppressed H2O2-induced acute cellular OCR, increasing the ROS level and indicating that STAT1/3 is necessary for ROS-induced mitochondria OCR and further ROS production, suggesting the existence of a STAT-ROS cycle. We next found that IFN induced mitochondria respiratory complexes followed by induction of OCR, ROS, and apoptosis, which were partially blocked by STAT1/3 deletion. Additionally, the suppression of ROS inhibited IFN‑induced STAT1/3 activation. Finally, we discovered that this cycle exists also in A431 and HeLa cancer cells. These results indicate that a STAT-ROS cycle extends IFN‑induced cellular apoptosis.},

  abstract = {Recent studies implicate reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide anions and H2O2 in the proliferation of systemic vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs). However, the role of ROS in SMC proliferation within the pulmonary circulation remains unclear. We investigated the effects of endothelin-1 (ET-1), a potential SMC mitogen, on ROS production and proliferation of fetal pulmonary artery SMCs (FPASMCs). Exposure to ET-1 resulted in increases in superoxide production and viable FPASMCs after 72 h. These increases were prevented by pretreatment with PD-156707. Treatment with pertussis toxin blocked the effects of ET-1, whereas cholera toxin stimulated superoxide production and increased viable cell numbers even in the absence of ET-1. Wortmannin, LY-294002, diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, and apocynin also prevented the ET-1-mediated increases in superoxide production and viable cell numbers. Exposure to H2O2 or diethyldithiocarbamate increased viable cell number by 37\% and 50\%, respectively. Conversely, ascorbic acid and DPI decreased viable cell number, which appeared to be due to an increase in programmed cell death. Our data suggest that ET-1 exerts a mitogenic effect on FPASMCs via an increase in ROS production and that antioxidants can block this effect via induction of apoptosis. Antioxidant treatment may therefore represent a potential therapy for pulmonary vascular diseases.},

Objectives We examined differences in monocyte subset numbers and expression of cell surface markers of activation (CD14) and chemotaxis (CCR2) in patients with acute HF (AHF), stable HF (SHF), and controls and evaluated their impact on clinical outcomes. Methods Three monocyte subsets [CD14++CD16−CCR2+ (Mon1), CD14++CD16+CCR2+ (Mon2) and CD14+CD16++CCR2− (Mon3)] were analysed by flow cytometry in 51 patients with AHF, 42 patients with SHF, 44 patients with stable coronary artery disease and without HF (CAD) and 40 healthy controls (HC). The prognostic impact of monocyte subsets was examined in AHF. Results Patients with AHF had significantly higher Mon1 counts compared to the three control groups (P {$<$} 0·001 for all). Similarly, Mon2 levels were increased in AHF compared to SHF (P = 0·004) and CAD (P {$<$} 0·001) and increased in SHF vs. CAD (P = 0·009). There were no differences in Mon3 counts between the groups. Twenty patients (39·2\%) with AHF reached the primary end-point of death or re-hospitalisation, and after adjustment for confounders, Mon2 count remained negatively associated with a combined end-point of death and re-hospitalisation [hazard ratio (per 10 cells/μL): 0·79; confidence interval: 0·66–0·94; P = 0·009]. Conclusions Mon2 counts are increased in patients with both acute and stable HF, with enhanced expression of surface markers of activation (CD14) and chemotaxis (CCR2). This subset was also associated with an adverse prognosis in patients with AHF.},

  abstract = {Multiple layers of vascular smooth muscle cells (vSMCs) are present in blood vessels forming the media of the vessel wall. vSMCs provide a vessel wall structure, enabling it to contract and relax, thus modulating blood flow. They also play a crucial role in the development of vascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis and aortic aneurysm formation. vSMCs display a remarkable high degree of plasticity. At present, the number of different vSMC phenotypes has only partially been characterized. By mapping vSMC phenotypes in detail and identifying triggers for phenotype switching, the relevance of the different phenotypes in vascular disease may be identified. Up until recently, vSMCs were classified as either contractile or dedifferentiated (ie, synthetic). However, single-cell RNA sequencing studies revealed such dedifferentiated arterial vSMCs to be highly diverse. Currently, no consensus exist about the number of vSMC phenotypes. Therefore, we reviewed the data from relevant single-cell RNA sequencing studies, and classified a total of 6 vSMC phenotypes. The central dedifferentiated vSMC type that we classified is the mesenchymal-like phenotype. Mesenchymal-like vSMCs subsequently seem to differentiate into fibroblast-like, macrophage-like, osteogenic-like, and adipocyte-like vSMCs, which contribute differentially to vascular disease. This phenotype switching between vSMCs requires the transcription factor KLF4 (Krüppel-like factor 4). Here, we performed an integrated analysis of the data about the recently identified vSMC phenotypes, their associated gene expression profiles, and previous vSMC knowledge to better understand the role of vSMC phenotype transitions in vascular pathology.},

  abstract = {Life on Earth evolved in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, and other peroxides also emerged before and with the rise of aerobic metabolism. They were considered only as toxic byproducts for many years. Nowadays, peroxides are also regarded as metabolic products that play essential physiological cellular roles. Organisms have developed efficient mechanisms to metabolize peroxides, mostly based on two kinds of redox chemistry, catalases/peroxidases that depend on the heme prosthetic group to afford peroxide reduction and thiol-based peroxidases that support their redox activities on specialized fast reacting cysteine/selenocysteine (Cys/Sec) residues. Among the last group, glutathione peroxidases (GPxs) and peroxiredoxins (Prxs) are the most widespread and abundant families, and they are the leitmotif of this review. After presenting the properties and roles of different peroxides in biology, we discuss the chemical mechanisms of peroxide reduction by low molecular weight thiols, Prxs, GPxs, and other thiol-based peroxidases. Special attention is paid to the catalytic properties of Prxs and also to the importance and comparative outlook of the properties of Sec and its role in GPxs. To finish, we describe and discuss the current views on the activities of thiol-based peroxidases in peroxide-mediated redox signaling processes.},

  abstract = {Current catalogs of regulatory sequences in the human genome are still incomplete and lack cell type resolution. To profile the activity of gene regulatory elements in diverse cell types and tissues in the human body, we applied single-cell chromatin accessibility assays to 30 adult human tissue types from multiple donors. We integrated these datasets with previous single-cell chromatin accessibility data from 15 fetal tissue types to reveal the status of open chromatin for ∼1.2 million candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) in 222 distinct cell types comprised of {$>$}1.3 million nuclei. We used these chromatin accessibility maps to delineate cell-type-specificity of fetal and adult human cCREs and to systematically interpret the noncoding variants associated with complex human traits and diseases. This rich resource provides a foundation for the analysis of gene regulatory programs in human cell types across tissues, life stages, and organ systems.},

  abstract = {Proangiogenesis is generally regarded as an effective approach for treating ischemic heart disease. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A is a strong and essential proangiogenic factor. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and autophagy are implicated in the process of angiogenesis. This study is designed to clarify the regulatory mechanisms underlying VEGF-A, ROS, ER stress, autophagy, and angiogenesis in acute myocardial infarction (AMI). A mouse model of AMI was successfully established by occluding the left anterior descending coronary artery. Compared with the sham-operated mice, the microvessel density, VEGF-A content, ROS production, expression of vascular endothelial cadherin, positive expression of 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein/binding immunoglobulin protein (GRP78/Bip), and LC3 puncta in CD31-positive endothelial cells of the ischemic myocardium were overtly elevated. Moreover, VEGF-A exposure predominantly increased the expression of beclin-1, autophagy-related gene (ATG) 4, ATG5, inositol-requiring enzyme-1 (IRE-1), GRP78/Bip, and LC3-II/LC3-I as well as ROS production in the human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in a dose and time-dependent manner. Both beclin-1 small interfering RNA and 3-methyladenine treatment predominantly mitigated VEGF-A-induced tube formation and migration of HUVECs, but they failed to elicit any notable effect on VEGF-A-increased expression of GRP78/Bip. Tauroursodeoxycholic acid not only obviously abolished VEGF-A-induced increase of IRE-1, GRP78/Bip, beclin-1 expression, and LC3-II/LC3-I, but also negated VEGF-A-induced tube formation and migration of HUVECs. Furthermore, N-acetyl- l-cysteine markedly abrogated VEGF-A-increased ROS production, IRE-1, GRP78/Bip, beclin-1 expression, and LC3-II/LC3-I in the HUVECs. Taken together, our data demonstrated that increased spontaneous production of VEGF-A may induce angiogenesis after AMI through initiating ROS–ER stress-autophagy axis in the vascular endothelial cells.},
