  abstract = {Smooth muscle cell (SMC) phenotypic modulation in atherosclerosis and in response to PDGF in vitro involves repression of differentiation marker genes and increases in SMC proliferation, migration, and matrix synthesis. However, SMCs within atherosclerotic plaques can also express a number of proinflammatory genes, and in cultured SMCs the inflammatory cytokine IL-1β represses SMC marker gene expression and induces inflammatory gene expression. Studies herein tested the hypothesis that IL-1β modulates SMC phenotype to a distinct inflammatory state relative to PDGF-DD. Genome-wide gene expression analysis of IL-1β- or PDGF-DD-treated SMCs revealed that although both stimuli repressed SMC differentiation marker gene expression, IL-1β distinctly induced expression of proinflammatory genes, while PDGF-DD primarily induced genes involved in cell proliferation. Promoters of inflammatory genes distinctly induced by IL-1β exhibited over-representation of NF-κB binding sites, and NF-κB inhibition in SMCs reduced IL-1β-induced upregulation of proinflammatory genes as well as repression of SMC differentiation marker genes. Interestingly, PDGF-DD-induced SMC marker gene repression was not NF-κB dependent. Finally, immunofluorescent staining of mouse atherosclerotic lesions revealed the presence of cells positive for the marker of an IL-1β-stimulated inflammatory SMC, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 20 (CCL20), but not the PDGF-DD-induced gene, regulator of G protein signaling 17 (RGS17). Results demonstrate that IL-1β- but not PDGF-DD-induced phenotypic modulation of SMC is characterized by NF-κB-dependent activation of proinflammatory genes, suggesting the existence of a distinct inflammatory SMC phenotype. In addition, studies provide evidence for the possible utility of CCL20 and RGS17 as markers of inflammatory and proliferative state SMCs within atherosclerotic plaques in vivo.},

  abstract = {Current knowledge suggests that intimal smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in native atherosclerotic plaque derive mainly from the medial arterial layer. During this process, SMCs undergo complex structural and functional changes giving rise to a broad spectrum of phenotypes. Classically, intimal SMCs are described as dedifferentiated/synthetic SMCs, a phenotype characterized by reduced expression of contractile proteins. Intimal SMCs are considered to have a beneficial role by contributing to the fibrous cap and thereby stabilizing atherosclerotic plaque. However, intimal SMCs can lose their properties to such an extent that they become hard to identify, contribute significantly to the foam cell population, and acquire inflammatory-like cell features. This review highlights mechanisms of SMC plasticity in different stages of native atherosclerotic plaque formation, their potential for monoclonal or oligoclonal expansion, as well as recent findings demonstrating the underestimated deleterious role of SMCs in this disease.},

  abstract = {Rapid progress of the discovery of genetic loci associated with common, complex diseases has outpaced the elucidation of mechanisms pertinent to disease pathogenesis. To address relevant barriers for coronary artery disease (CAD), we combined genetic discovery analyses with downstream characterization of likely causal variants, genes, and biological pathways. Specifically, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) comprising 181,522 cases of CAD among 1,165,690 participants. We detected 241 associations, including 54 associations and 30 loci not previously linked to CAD. Next, we prioritized likely causal variants using functionally-informed fine-mapping, yielding 42 associations with fewer than five variants in the 95\% credible set. Combining eight complementary predictors, we prioritized 185 candidate causal genes, including 94 genes supported by three or more predictors. Similarity-based clustering underscored a role for early developmental processes, cell cycle signaling, and vascular proliferation in the pathogenesis of CAD. Our analysis identifies and systematically characterizes risk loci for CAD to inform experimental interrogation of putative causal mechanisms for CAD.},

  abstract = {The Notch signaling pathway is a highly conserved pathway involved in cell fate determination in embryonic development and also functions in the regulation of physiological processes in several systems. It plays an especially important role in vascular development and physiology by influencing angiogenesis, vessel patterning, arterial/venous specification, and vascular smooth muscle biology. Aberrant or dysregulated Notch signaling is the cause of or a contributing factor to many vascular disorders, including inherited vascular diseases, such as cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy, associated with degeneration of the smooth muscle layer in cerebral arteries. Like most signaling pathways, the Notch signaling axis is influenced by complex interactions with mediators of other signaling pathways. This complexity is also compounded by different members of the Notch family having both overlapping and unique functions. Thus, it is vital to fully understand the roles and interactions of each Notch family member in order to effectively and specifically target their exact contributions to vascular disease. In this chapter, we will review the Notch signaling pathway in vascular smooth muscle cells as it relates to vascular development and human disease.},

  abstract = {The historical view of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in atherosclerosis is that ‘aberrant’ proliferation of VSMCs promotes plaque formation, but that VSMCs in advanced plaques are entirely beneficial, for example preventing rupture of the fibrous cap. However, this view has been based on ideas that there is a homogenous population of VSMCs within the plaque, that can be identified separate from other plaque cells (particularly macrophages) using standard VSMC and macrophage immunohistochemical ‘markers’. More recent genetic lineage tracing studies have shown that VSMC phenotypic switching results in less differentiated forms that lack VSMC ‘markers’ including macrophage-like cells, and this switching directly promotes atherosclerosis. In addition, VSMC proliferation may be beneficial throughout atherogenesis, and not just in advanced lesions, whereas VSMC apoptosis, cell senescence, and VSMC-derived macrophage-like cells may promote inflammation. We review the effect of embryological origin on VSMC behavior in atherosclerosis, the role, regulation and consequences of phenotypic switching, the evidence for different origins of VSMCs, and the role of individual processes that VSMCs undergo in atherosclerosis in regard to plaque formation and the structure of advanced lesions. We believe there is now compelling evidence that a full understanding of VSMC behavior in atherosclerosis is critical to identifying therapeutic targets to both prevent and treat atherosclerosis.},

However, details of spatiotemporal organization of specific signaling pathways that H2O2 is involved in are currently missing. Here, we use single nanoparticle imaging to measure the local H2O2 concentration and reveal regulation of the ROS response dynamics and organization to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) signaling. We demonstrate that H2O2 production is controlled by PDGFR kinase activity and EGFR transactivation, requires a persistent stimulation, and is regulated by membrane receptor diffusion. This temporal filtering is impaired in cancer cells, which may determine their pathological migration. H2O2 subcellular mapping reveals that an external PDGF gradient induces an amplification-free asymmetric H2O2 concentration profile. These results support a general model for the control of signal transduction based only on membrane receptor diffusion and second messenger degradation.},

  abstract = {A number of infectious agents have been implicated in the development of vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis and posttransplantation arterial restenosis. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) has been reported to cause obliteration of coronary arteries by a progressive vasculopathy that involves proliferation of medial smooth muscle cells (SMC). In this study, we report that CMV enhances the serum-induced proliferation of human coronary SMC through activation of a superoxide-generating NADPH oxidase. Exposure of SMC to CMV for 2 h was associated with an 80\% increase in NADPH oxidase. This increase in oxidase activity was associated with a two-fold increase in serum-induced DNA synthesis (5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine incorporation) and significant interleukin-8 (IL-8) production by SMC. Diphenylene iodonium, an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase, significantly inhibited CMV-induced IL-8 production and promotion of serum-induced DNA synthesis. Similar effects were seen following pretreatment of SMC with N-acetyl cysteine, a potent antioxidant, suggesting that oxidative stress following CMV exposure might be responsible for triggering the proliferation of SMC. From this study, we conclude that CMV-mediated promotion of SMC growth is redox sensitive and may be mediated by NADPH oxidase.},

The interactions between the main cellular sources of ROS, such as mitochondria and NADPH oxidases, however, remain obscure. This work summarizes the latest findings on the role of cross talk between mitochondria and NADPH oxidases in pathophysiological processes. Mitochondria have the highest levels of antioxidants in the cell and play an important role in the maintenance of cellular redox status, thereby acting as an ROS and redox sink and limiting NADPH oxidase activity. Mitochondria, however, are not only a target for ROS produced by NADPH oxidase but also a significant source of ROS, which under certain conditions may stimulate NADPH oxidases. This cross talk between mitochondria and NADPH oxidases, therefore, may represent a feed-forward vicious cycle of ROS production, which can be pharmacologically targeted under conditions of oxidative stress. It has been demonstrated that mitochondria-targeted antioxidants break this vicious cycle, inhibiting ROS production by mitochondria and reducing NADPH oxidase activity. This may provide a novel strategy for treatment of many pathological conditions including aging, atherosclerosis, diabetes, hypertension, and degenerative neurological disorders in which mitochondrial oxidative stress seems to play a role. It is conceivable that the use of mitochondria-targeted treatments would be effective in these conditions.},

It has been reported to lower endogenous oxidant levels and to protect cells against a wide range of pro-oxidative insults. As NAC itself is a poor scavenger of oxidants, the molecular mechanisms behind the antioxidative effects of NAC have remained uncertain. Here we show that NAC-derived cysteine is desulfurated to generate hydrogen sulfide, which in turn is oxidized to sulfane sulfur species, predominantly within mitochondria. We provide evidence suggesting the possibility that sulfane sulfur species produced by 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase and sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase are the actual mediators of the immediate antioxidative and cytoprotective effects provided by NAC.},

  abstract = {Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) are key participants in both early and late-stage atherosclerosis. VSMCs invade the early atherosclerotic lesion from the media, expanding lesions, but also forming a protective fibrous cap rich in extracellular matrix to cover the ‘necrotic’ core. Hence, VSMCs have been viewed as plaque-stabilizing, and decreased VSMC plaque content—often measured by expression of contractile markers—associated with increased plaque vulnerability. However, the emergence of lineage-tracing and transcriptomic studies has demonstrated that VSMCs comprise a much larger proportion of atherosclerotic plaques than originally thought, demonstrate multiple different phenotypes in vivo, and have roles that might be detrimental. VSMCs down-regulate contractile markers during atherosclerosis whilst adopting alternative phenotypes, including macrophage-like, foam cell-like, osteochondrogenic-like, myofibroblast-like, and mesenchymal stem cell-like. VSMC phenotypic switching can be studied in tissue culture, but also now in the media, fibrous cap and deep-core region, and markedly affects plaque formation and markers of stability. In this review, we describe the different VSMC plaque phenotypes and their presumed cellular and paracrine functions, the regulatory mechanisms that control VSMC plasticity, and their impact on atherogenesis and plaque stability.},

  abstract = {Events responsible for cardiovascular mortality and morbidity are predominantly caused by rupture of “vulnerable” atherosclerotic lesions. Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) play a key role in atherogenesis and have historically been considered beneficial for plaque stability. VSMCs constitute the main cellular component of the protective fibrous cap within lesions and are responsible for synthesising strength‐giving extracellular matrix components. However, lineage‐tracing experiments in mouse models of atherosclerosis have shown that, in addition to the fibrous cap, VSMCs also give rise to many of the cell types found within the plaque core. In particular, VSMCs generate a substantial fraction of lipid‐laden foam cells, and VSMC‐derived cells expressing markers of macrophages, osteochondrocyte, and mesenchymal stem cells have been observed within lesions. Here, we review recent studies that have changed our perspective on VSMC function in atherosclerosis and discuss how VSMCs could be targeted to increase plaque stability.},

However, the direct effects of PDGF receptor β (PDGFRβ) activation on VSMCs have not been studied in the context of atherosclerosis. Here we present a new mouse model of atherosclerosis with an activating mutation in PDGFRβ. Increased PDGFRβ signalling induces chemokine secretion and leads to leukocyte accumulation in the adventitia and media of the aorta. Furthermore, PDGFRβD849V amplifies and accelerates atherosclerosis in hypercholesterolemic ApoE−/− or Ldlr−/− mice. Intriguingly, increased PDGFRβ signalling promotes advanced plaque formation at novel sites in the thoracic aorta and coronary arteries. However, deletion of the PDGFRβ-activated transcription factor STAT1 in VSMCs alleviates inflammation of the arterial wall and reduces plaque burden. These results demonstrate that PDGFRβ pathway activation has a profound effect on vascular disease and support the conclusion that inflammation in the outer arterial layers is a driving process for atherosclerosis.},

  abstract = {The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor characterized to play a role in detection and adaptation to environmental stimuli. Genetic deletion of the AhR results in cardiac hypertrophy that is mediated primarily by endothelin-1 (ET-1); ET-1 has been implicated in the elevation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the heart, which are thought to contribute to several cardiovascular disorders, including cardiac hypertrophy. Thus, we tested the novel hypothesis that ET-1 induces ROS in AhR null mice via ETA receptor activation. We first confirmed the presence of ROS in the hearts of AhR null mice by measuring superoxide (\textbackslash batchmode \textbackslash documentclass[fleqn,10pt,legalpaper]\{article\} \textbackslash usepackage\{amssymb\} \textbackslash usepackage\{amsfonts\} \textbackslash usepackage\{amsmath\} \textbackslash pagestyle\{empty\} \textbackslash begin\{document\} \textbackslash (\textbackslash mathrm\{O\}\_\{2\}\^\{\{\textbackslash bullet\}\{-\}\}\textbackslash ) \textbackslash end\{document\})-dependent oxidation of dihydroethidium. Ethidium fluorescence was increased 10-fold in the hearts of AhR null mice, compared to the wild type. Then, to elucidate whether ET-1 mediated the increase in ROS, mice were chronically treated with 100 ng/kg/day of the ETA receptor antagonist BQ-123. In AhR null mice, BQ-123 significantly reduced elevated plasma 8-isoprostane, a systemic end product of phospholipid oxidation by ROS, and cardiac thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), a nonspecific assessment of ROS production. Furthermore, BQ-123 reduced both cardiac lucigenin chemiluminescence and cardiac mRNA expression of NAD(P)H oxidase subunits gp91phox, p47phox, and p67phox in AhR null mice below the levels observed in wild-type mice. These findings demonstrate that ET-1 activation of ETA receptors mediates an increase in ROS that is associated with cardiac hypertrophy in AhR null mice. In addition, the ET-1–mediated increase in ROS appears to be initiated via increased NAD(P)H oxidase activity.},

  abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of noncoding loci that are associated with human diseases and complex traits, each of which could reveal insights into the mechanisms of disease1. Many of the underlying causal variants may affect enhancers2,3, but we lack accurate maps of enhancers and their target genes to interpret such variants. We recently developed the activity-by-contact (ABC) model to predict which enhancers regulate which genes and validated the model using CRISPR perturbations in several cell types4. Here we apply this ABC model to create enhancer–gene~maps in 131 human cell types and tissues, and use these maps to interpret the functions of GWAS variants. Across 72 diseases and complex traits, ABC links 5,036 GWAS signals to 2,249 unique genes, including a class of 577 genes that appear to influence multiple phenotypes through variants in enhancers that act in different cell types. In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), causal variants are enriched in predicted enhancers by more than 20-fold in particular cell types such as dendritic cells, and ABC achieves higher precision than other regulatory methods at connecting noncoding variants to target genes. These variant-to-function maps reveal an enhancer that contains an IBD risk variant and that regulates the expression of PPIF to alter the membrane potential of mitochondria in macrophages. Our study reveals principles of genome regulation, identifies genes that affect IBD and provides a resource and generalizable strategy to connect risk variants of common diseases to their molecular and cellular functions.},

  abstract = {Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) develop a highly proliferative and synthetic phenotype in arterial diseases. Because such phenotypic changes are likely integrated with the energetic state of the cell, we hypothesized that changes in cellular metabolism regulate VSMC plasticity. VSMCs were exposed to platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF) and changes in mitochondrial morphology, proliferation, contractile protein expression, and mitochondrial metabolism were examined. Exposure of VSMCs to PDGF resulted in mitochondrial fragmentation and a 50\% decrease in the abundance of mitofusin 2. Synthetic VSMCs demonstrated a 20\% decrease in glucose oxidation, which was accompanied by an increase in fatty acid oxidation. Results of mitochondrial function assays in permeabilized cells showed few changes due to PDGF treatment in mitochondrial respiratory chain capacity and coupling. Treatment of VSMCs with Mdivi-1-an inhibitor of mitochondrial fission-inhibited PDGF-induced mitochondrial fragmentation by 50\% and abolished increases in cell proliferation; however, it failed to prevent PDGF-mediated activation of autophagy and removal of contractile proteins. In addition, treatment with Mdivi-1 reversed changes in fatty acid and glucose oxidation associated with the synthetic phenotype. These results suggest that changes in mitochondrial morphology and bioenergetics underlie the hyperproliferative features of the synthetic VSMC phenotype, but do not affect the degradation of contractile proteins. Mitochondrial fragmentation occurring during the transition to the synthetic phenotype could be a therapeutic target for hyperproliferative vascular disorders.},

  abstract = {KEY POINTS: Smooth muscle cell (SMC) phenotypic conversion from a contractile to a migratory phenotype is proposed to underlie cardiovascular disease but its contribution to vascular remodelling and even its existence have recently been questioned. Tracking the fate of individual SMCs is difficult as no specific markers of migratory SMCs exist. This study used a novel, prolonged time-lapse imaging approach to continuously track the behaviour of unambiguously identified, fully differentiated SMCs. In response to serum, highly-elongated, contractile SMCs initially rounded up, before spreading and migrating and these migratory cells displayed clear phagocytic activity. This study provides a direct demonstration of the transition of fully contractile SMCs to a non-contractile, migratory phenotype with phagocytic capacity that may act as a macrophage-like cell. ABSTRACT: Atherosclerotic plaques are populated with smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and macrophages. SMCs are thought to accumulate in plaques because fully differentiated, contractile SMCs reprogramme into a 'synthetic' migratory phenotype, so-called phenotypic modulation, whilst plaque macrophages are thought to derive from blood-borne myeloid cells. Recently, these views have been challenged, with reports that SMC phenotypic modulation may not occur during vascular remodelling and that plaque macrophages may not be of haematopoietic origin. Following the fate of SMCs is complicated by the lack of specific markers for the migratory phenotype and direct demonstrations of phenotypic modulation are lacking. Therefore, we employed long-term, high-resolution, time-lapse microscopy to track the fate of unambiguously identified, fully-differentiated, contractile SMCs in response to the growth factors present in serum. Phenotypic modulation was clearly observed. The highly elongated, contractile SMCs initially rounded up, for 1-3~days, before spreading outwards. Once spread, the SMCs became motile and displayed dynamic cell-cell communication behaviours. Significantly, they also displayed clear evidence of phagocytic activity. This macrophage-like behaviour was confirmed by their internalisation of 1~μm fluorescent latex beads. However, migratory SMCs did not uptake acetylated low-density lipoprotein or express the classic macrophage marker CD68. These results directly demonstrate that SMCs may rapidly undergo phenotypic modulation and develop phagocytic capabilities. Resident SMCs may provide a potential source of macrophages in vascular remodelling.},

  abstract = {The pathobiology of atherosclerotic disease requires further elucidation to discover new approaches to address its high morbidity and mortality. To date, over 17 million cardiovascular-related deaths have been reported annually, despite a multitude of surgical and nonsurgical interventions and advances in medical therapy. Existing strategies to prevent disease progression mainly focus on management of risk factors, such as hypercholesterolemia. Even with optimum current medical therapy, recurrent cardiovascular events are not uncommon in patients with atherosclerosis, and their incidence can reach 10–15\% per year. Although treatments targeting inflammation are under investigation and continue to evolve, clinical breakthroughs are possible only if we deepen our understanding of vessel wall pathobiology. Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) are one of the most abundant cells in vessel walls and have emerged as key players in disease progression. New technologies, including in situ hybridization proximity ligation assays, in vivo cell fate tracing with the CreERT2-loxP system and single-cell sequencing technology with spatial resolution, broaden our understanding of the complex biology of these intriguing cells. Our knowledge of contractile and synthetic VSMC phenotype switching has expanded to include macrophage-like and even osteoblast-like VSMC phenotypes. An increasing body of data suggests that VSMCs have remarkable plasticity and play a key role in cell-to-cell crosstalk with endothelial cells and immune cells during the complex process of inflammation. These are cells that sense, interact with and influence the behavior of other cellular components of the vessel wall. It is now more obvious that VSMC plasticity and the ability to perform nonprofessional phagocytic functions are key phenomena maintaining the inflammatory state and senescent condition and actively interacting with different immune competent cells.},

  abstract = {Increased vascular production of reactive oxygen species (ROS; termed oxidative stress) has been implicated in various chronic diseases, including hypertension. Oxidative stress is both a cause and a consequence of hypertension. Although oxidative injury may not be the sole etiology, it amplifies blood pressure elevation in the presence of other pro-hypertensive factors. Oxidative stress is a multisystem phenomenon in hypertension and involves the heart, kidneys, nervous system, vessels and possibly the immune system. Compelling experimental and clinical evidence indicates the importance of the vasculature in the pathophysiology of hypertension and as such much emphasis has been placed on the (patho)biology of ROS in the vascular system. A major source for cardiovascular, renal and neural ROS is a family of non-phagocytic nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidases (Nox), including the prototypic Nox2 homolog-based NADPH oxidase, as well as other Noxes, such as Nox1 and Nox4. Nox-derived ROS is important in regulating endothelial function and vascular tone. Oxidative stress is implicated in endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, hypertrophy, apoptosis, migration, fibrosis, angiogenesis and rarefaction, important processes involved in vascular remodeling in hypertension. Despite a plethora of data implicating oxidative stress as a causative factor in experimental hypertension, findings in human hypertension are less conclusive. This review highlights the importance of ROS in vascular biology and focuses on the potential role of oxidative stress in human hypertension.},

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified over 170 loci associated with CAD, where the majority of risk variants reside in noncoding DNA sequences impacting cis-regulatory elements (CREs). Here, we applied single-cell ATAC-seq to profile 28,316 cells across coronary artery segments from 41 patients with varying stages of CAD, which revealed 14 distinct cellular clusters. We mapped \textasciitilde 320,000 accessible sites across all cells, identified cell type-specific elements, transcription factors, and prioritized functional CAD risk variants via quantitative trait locus and sequence-based predictive modeling. We identified a number of candidate mechanisms for smooth muscle cell transition states and identified putative binding sites for risk variants. We further employed CRE to gene linkage to nominate disease-associated key driver transcription factors such as PRDM16 and TBX2. This single cell atlas provides a critical step towards interpreting cis-regulatory mechanisms in the vessel wall across the continuum of CAD risk.},

  abstract = {Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of mortality worldwide and poses a considerable public health burden. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed {$>$}100 genetic loci associated with CAD susceptibility in humans. While a number of these loci harbor gene targets of currently approved therapies, such as statins and PCSK9 inhibitors, the majority of the annotated genes at these loci encode for proteins involved in vessel wall function with no known drugs available. Importantly many of the associated genes linked to vascular (smooth muscle, endothelial, and macrophage) cell processes are now organized into distinct functional pathways, e.g., vasodilation, growth factor responses, extracellular matrix and plaque remodeling, and inflammation. In this mini-review, we highlight the most recently identified loci that have predicted roles in the vessel wall and provide genetic context for pre-existing therapies as well as new drug targets informed from GWAS. With the development of new modalities to target these pathways, (e.g., antisense oligonucleotides, CRISPR/Cas9, and RNA interference) as well as the computational frameworks to prioritize or reposition therapeutics, there is great opportunity to close the gap from initial genetic discovery to clinical translation for many patients affected by this common disease.},

  abstract = {Recent studies implicate reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide anions and H2O2 in the proliferation of systemic vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs). However, the role of ROS in SMC proliferation within the pulmonary circulation remains unclear. We investigated the effects of endothelin-1 (ET-1), a potential SMC mitogen, on ROS production and proliferation of fetal pulmonary artery SMCs (FPASMCs). Exposure to ET-1 resulted in increases in superoxide production and viable FPASMCs after 72 h. These increases were prevented by pretreatment with PD-156707. Treatment with pertussis toxin blocked the effects of ET-1, whereas cholera toxin stimulated superoxide production and increased viable cell numbers even in the absence of ET-1. Wortmannin, LY-294002, diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, and apocynin also prevented the ET-1-mediated increases in superoxide production and viable cell numbers. Exposure to H2O2 or diethyldithiocarbamate increased viable cell number by 37\% and 50\%, respectively. Conversely, ascorbic acid and DPI decreased viable cell number, which appeared to be due to an increase in programmed cell death. Our data suggest that ET-1 exerts a mitogenic effect on FPASMCs via an increase in ROS production and that antioxidants can block this effect via induction of apoptosis. Antioxidant treatment may therefore represent a potential therapy for pulmonary vascular diseases.},

  abstract = {Multiple layers of vascular smooth muscle cells (vSMCs) are present in blood vessels forming the media of the vessel wall. vSMCs provide a vessel wall structure, enabling it to contract and relax, thus modulating blood flow. They also play a crucial role in the development of vascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis and aortic aneurysm formation. vSMCs display a remarkable high degree of plasticity. At present, the number of different vSMC phenotypes has only partially been characterized. By mapping vSMC phenotypes in detail and identifying triggers for phenotype switching, the relevance of the different phenotypes in vascular disease may be identified. Up until recently, vSMCs were classified as either contractile or dedifferentiated (ie, synthetic). However, single-cell RNA sequencing studies revealed such dedifferentiated arterial vSMCs to be highly diverse. Currently, no consensus exist about the number of vSMC phenotypes. Therefore, we reviewed the data from relevant single-cell RNA sequencing studies, and classified a total of 6 vSMC phenotypes. The central dedifferentiated vSMC type that we classified is the mesenchymal-like phenotype. Mesenchymal-like vSMCs subsequently seem to differentiate into fibroblast-like, macrophage-like, osteogenic-like, and adipocyte-like vSMCs, which contribute differentially to vascular disease. This phenotype switching between vSMCs requires the transcription factor KLF4 (Krüppel-like factor 4). Here, we performed an integrated analysis of the data about the recently identified vSMC phenotypes, their associated gene expression profiles, and previous vSMC knowledge to better understand the role of vSMC phenotype transitions in vascular pathology.},

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A is a strong and essential proangiogenic factor. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and autophagy are implicated in the process of angiogenesis. This study is designed to clarify the regulatory mechanisms underlying VEGF-A, ROS, ER stress, autophagy, and angiogenesis in acute myocardial infarction (AMI). A mouse model of AMI was successfully established by occluding the left anterior descending coronary artery. Compared with the sham-operated mice, the microvessel density, VEGF-A content, ROS production, expression of vascular endothelial cadherin, positive expression of 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein/binding immunoglobulin protein (GRP78/Bip), and LC3 puncta in CD31-positive endothelial cells of the ischemic myocardium were overtly elevated. Moreover, VEGF-A exposure predominantly increased the expression of beclin-1, autophagy-related gene (ATG) 4, ATG5, inositol-requiring enzyme-1 (IRE-1), GRP78/Bip, and LC3-II/LC3-I as well as ROS production in the human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in a dose and time-dependent manner. Both beclin-1 small interfering RNA and 3-methyladenine treatment predominantly mitigated VEGF-A-induced tube formation and migration of HUVECs, but they failed to elicit any notable effect on VEGF-A-increased expression of GRP78/Bip. Tauroursodeoxycholic acid not only obviously abolished VEGF-A-induced increase of IRE-1, GRP78/Bip, beclin-1 expression, and LC3-II/LC3-I, but also negated VEGF-A-induced tube formation and migration of HUVECs. Furthermore, N-acetyl- l-cysteine markedly abrogated VEGF-A-increased ROS production, IRE-1, GRP78/Bip, beclin-1 expression, and LC3-II/LC3-I in the HUVECs. Taken together, our data demonstrated that increased spontaneous production of VEGF-A may induce angiogenesis after AMI through initiating ROS–ER stress-autophagy axis in the vascular endothelial cells.},
